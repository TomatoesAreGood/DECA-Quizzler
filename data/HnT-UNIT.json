D To determine where to locate a new restaurant based on population growth. The U.S. Census data provide information on designated geographic areas that indicate demographic data, social data, and economic data, and allow comparisons across years. The restaurant could use the data to determine whether a geographic area is growing. The type of restaurant to open is already pre-determined by the types of restaurants in the chain. The census data cannot determine whether management personnel want to run a new restaurant, but they provide insight into the percentages of people in management and the educational levels of people in the area.

C Trade magazines. These publications provide insight into technological changes occurring specifically in hospitality and tourism marketing. They are also a good source to use when tracking social/cultural changes and legal changes. By staying on top of environmental changes occurring in the industry, hospitality and tourism marketers are better positioned to take advantage of the changes. Customers may or may not be in the hospitality and tourism industry, so their knowledge of technological changes will probably be limited. The average check size is a good source to track when examining economic changes. Consumer magazines are of general interest and would not address the hospitality and tourism industry specifically.

Then, add the values and divide by the number of respondents (30 + 164 + 342 + 384 + 335 + 186 = 1,441; 1,441 / 420 = 3.43 or 3.4).

When employees write e-mail messages to coworkers or customers, the recipients of the messages can forward them to others without the sender's knowledge or permission. Therefore, employees should be cautious about the content of e-mail messages because they have no control over what the recipients do with the e-mails.

Productivity is the amount of work employees perform in a given time period. Collaborative computer software allows many employees to access the same business information. Some applications, such as e-mail, allow employees to instantly transmit messages and business documents to coworkers who are traveling or working in other facilities, which can facilitate a quick response. Quick responses can increase an employee's productivity because the employee can take immediate action and then proceed to work on other tasks. Collaborative computer software does not necessarily increase an employee's independence or motivation because other factors can affect a person's independence (e.g., type of job) and motivation. The business, rather than its employees, receives the profit that might result from increases in the employees' productivity. SOURCE: NF:011 SOURCE: Sheldon, T. (n.d.). Groupware.

Because technology is constantly evolving, many people believe that videotapes are outdated, if not obsolete. Insufficient information is provided to determine whether the business office offers a safe environment. In addition, vital records may be kept in areas other than the business office. Filing records in cardboard boxes is not safe because cardboard boxes may be destroyed by fire or water. SOURCE: NF:001 SOURCE: NF LAP 1\u2014Record It (Business Records) 58. D To obtain useful information. Statistical findings need to be interpreted in order to convert them to useful information. Simply gathering statistics, which are data presented in numerical form, is not helpful unless a business analyzes them and converts them to useful information. For example, it is not useful to know that 500 customers buy a certain product unless the business also knows the total number of potential customers and what percentage of the potential customers are current customers. Perhaps 500 seems like a strong customer base, but that is not the case if the potential is 10,000. Businesses often use statistical findings to develop charts and tables and calculate the median. However, those are not reasons why the business interprets them. Businesses do not interpret statistical findings to organize a database.

D Rely less on the use of travel agencies for business. The Internet has made it possible for individuals to bypass travel agencies by checking on room availability and making their own reservations online. This is beneficial for properties because they don't have to pay as many sales commissions to travel agencies. The number of guest reservations that need to be processed so that guests can be assigned a room upon check-in remains the same, regardless of whether the reservation was made online or offline. The property still needs to communicate important information about reservations, including a confirmation number, through e-mail or by other means. The number of individuals needed to staff the front desk is not affected by an online reservations system, although the number of reservation clerks required to take telephone reservations might be.

Employee pilferage involves the taking of small amounts or small articles without the consent of the company. That is what occurs when an employee pads his/her expense account. Changing the amount specified on a check is an example of fraud. Installing personally owned software on your computer at work is against most companies' policies; however, it does not represent employee pilferage. Hacking into your company's computer to obtain trade secrets is a computer crime. Since losing trade secrets can be very costly to the company, it does not qualify as pilferage.

Motels must be prepared to handle emergencies if they occur. Depending on the property's geographic location, the property might be more likely to experience some emergencies (e.g., earthquakes, floods) than others. And because the effects of natural disasters differ from one another, motels should have procedures for the various types of emergencies they are likely to encounter. A motel should thoroughly explain to employees the procedures for each emergency it might face. By preparing employees for each type of emergency, the employees can better respond and get guests, themselves, and coworkers out of harms way. The sprinkler system usually goes off automatically when fires occur. Calling medical professionals and administering first aid may or may not be necessary and depends on the type of emergency at hand. SOURCE: OP:119 SOURCE: Stutts, A.T., & Wortman, J.F. (2006).

An employee who answers phone calls and manages the office schedule works in administrative services. Employees working in administrative services facilitate business operations through a wide range of duties, including information and communication management, data processing and collection, and project tracking. These positions are often referred to as support staff positions. This employee would not be working in operations management, corporate/general management, or human resource management. Employees working in operations management focus on planning, organizing, coordinating, and controlling the resources needed to produce/provide a business's goods and/or services. Careers in corporate/general management focus on planning, organizing, directing, and evaluating part or all of a business organization through the allocation and use of financial, human, and material resources. Human resource management careers focus on the staffing activities that involve planning, recruitment, selection, orientation, training, performance appraisal, compensation, and safety of employees.

Potential employers usually do not want to contact your classmates, family members, and coworkers because they are personal references who may be unable to provide unbiased information about you.

B The chamber of commerce because local chapters are often involved in special sales-promotion events. The Chamber is a nonprofit organization dedicated to facilitating community leadership to create economic prosperity. The purpose of the National Restaurant Association is to provide services to the restaurant industry at the national level and is not involved with local events. The same is true with the Hospitality and Tourism Association. The mall, while possibly being involved with the summer festival, is more concerned with bringing customers to the mall and not just to the restaurant, if the restaurant is located within the mall.

D Join a professional trade association. Most segments within the hospitality industry (e.g., travel agents, hotels, restaurants, intermediaries) have organizations that provide research, educational, and promotional information as well as current trends. Most organizations charge membership fees to belong. The fees can be used to develop programs and conduct research. Information can be communicated by meetings, seminars, newsletters and web sites. These organizations also provide leverage and input regarding legislation pertaining to the hospitality industry. A motivational speaker might encourage the manager to succeed on the job but does not necessarily provide detailed industry-related information. Training manuals are written documents that outline procedures to complete tasks; they do not provide industry trends, education, and promotion information. An assessment consultant who evaluates staff does not necessarily have information regarding trends, education, and promotion within the hospitality industry.

C A decrease in the number of guests and an increase in the number of rooms available. A decrease in the number of guests occurs during economic slowdowns because people are reluctant to spend their discretionary income on travel. Consequently, there is an increase in the number of rooms available as more rooms become available for rent. An increase in the number of guests and an increase in the number of rooms available does not follow the law of supply and demand, which suggests that as demand for rooms go up, supply typically goes down. A decrease in the number of guests and a decrease in the number of rooms available would work the other way because as demand goes down, the supply of rooms available for rent typically goes up. An increase in the number of guests and a decrease in the number of rooms available typically occurs during good economic times when people are more willing to spend their discretionary income on travel.

Demand is the quantity of a good or service that buyers are ready to buy at a given price at a particular time. Demand has a significant effect on the price of travel and tourism products because if demand is high, prices often increase because travelers are willing to pay more to obtain the products they want. For example, if demand for a cruise is high during certain times of the year, the price of cabins will increase because there are many travelers who want to book passage on that cruise. On the other hand, prices usually decrease as demand decreases because fewer travelers want to buy travel products. Demand does not have a significant effect on the availability, quality, or source of travel and tourism products. SOURCE: PI:039 SOURCE: Morrison, A.M. (2002).

Positioning is a product mix strategy in which a business creates a certain image or impression of a product in the minds of consumers. For a new product, businesses often try to develop a unique positioning concept that will set the new product apart from competitors. For example, the new product may have features that competing products do not have. These features make the product unique so the business can position the product based on its unique features. Businesses do not develop a unique positioning concept for a new product to monitor its growth stage, to create an original marketing plan, or to identify innovative objectives.

The core product in the hospitality industry is lodging, which involves providing overnight sleeping accommodations for guests. The various segments of the hospitality industry offer a range of accommodations including economy, full-service, and resort. Many properties also offer complementary products, such as entertainment, food service, and retailing; however, the main product is lodging. For example, an economy property that provides rooms is selling only the core product, while a resort that has many restaurants, nightly entertainment, and retail shops is selling the core product as well as complementary products.

A resort that is located near a large amusement park might provide shuttle service to transport its guests to the amusement park. Resort guests who arrive by airplane often do not have automobiles to drive to the resort. Therefore, a resort that provides shuttle service to a nearby attraction is meeting a segment of its guests' needs. Courier service usually offers same- or next-day delivery of documents and small parcels; courier service is often used by businesses. Room service is the delivery of food and beverage to a guest's sleeping room or meeting room. Dining service refers to the overall food and beverage operation, which includes the resort's restaurant and banquet facilities. While room service and dining service are not available at all lodging facilities, food and beverage service is usually a standard service rather than a distinct service that large resorts offer.

Streaming media are sound, video, or animations that play in real time. E-mail is capable of delivering streaming media when the recipient opens the message or clicks on a \"play\" button. Streaming media are very expensive to produce, and for it to work properly, the recipient needs a high-speed Internet connection. Therefore, it is not delivered through e-mail very often. Streaming media do not require the recipient to have an unlisted telephone number, a sophisticated computer keyboard, or a complicated operating system.

One of the reasons that businesses use color in advertisements is to present their products in an attractive and realistic manner. Readers are attracted to color ads and can identify more easily with products that are depicted in their actual color. The main purpose of using vivid colors in advertisements is to provide realism rather than to offer choices or create balance. Businesses do not want to distract readers from their advertisements.

Typography is the effective use of type. However, typography involves more than the type or lettering. It involves the style and size of type as well as the space between letters or words. Typography has a significant effect on the look of an ad and helps to convey a message and express a certain feeling. Therefore, typography is an important part of designing an effective advertisement. Creating a storyboard is an important part of developing a television commercial. Frequency and position are factors to consider when placing print ads. SOURCE: PR:295 SOURCE: Lane, W.R., King, K.W., & Russell, J.T. (2005). Kleppner's advertising procedure (16th ed.) [p. 547].

A database is computerized storage for information and facts. The use of databases is one way of tracking marketing-communications activities. For example, a business sends out 100,000 promotional letters to customers and receives 25,000 responses. The business maintains a database of the names and characteristics of 100,000 customers as well as information about those who responded. The business can analyze the database to track the effectiveness of the mailing in reaching the target market. Questionnaires, surveys, and interviews are ways of obtaining marketing information rather than ways of tracking marketing-communications activities.

Digital color printing uses computer-based files to print high-quality promotional materials such as advertisements. Digital color is a full-color printing process that often is less expensive than other types of printing processes. It is a process that is being used more frequently because many ads are created on a computer. Digital color is not a type of media strategy, graphic design, or advertising method.

Many businesses are involved in community activities. The benefit to the business is that this involvement often sets it apart from competitors who may not be involved in community activities. The business usually receives positive publicity for its involvement which helps to create a good public image. Customers often are attracted to these companies because of the publicity and decide to do business with them rather than with their competitors. Businesses often compensate employees if they ask employees to spend time participating in community activities, such as fundraisers for charitable organizations. Being involved in community activities does not help a business to test new products, nor does it necessarily make it possible for customers to meet top management.

Businesses often identify community issues for company involvement. When considering possible issues, businesses often look for those that will contribute to the social good, such as helping needy families, supporting education, mentoring at-risk teenagers, etc. The intent is to become involved in activities that will improve the community and benefit the citizens. When identifying community issues for company involvement, businesses usually do not consider which ones will earn a reasonable profit, generate positive publicity, or build consumer loyalty. However, as a result of being involved in community activities, a business might receive positive publicity which will help build consumer loyalty and increase profit.

A captioned photograph is a picture that is accompanied by written text called a caption. Including a photograph with a print news release can help to get information presented.

Businesses should send a thank-you note to the editor after the release is used. Businesses do not include promotional souvenirs or reference lists with a news release.

To determine the customer's meeting-room needs, the hotel's sales staff needs to ask a few general questions about the room's intended use.

Asking about audio-visual needs is one of the \u201cwhat's\u201d that needs to be determined so that the customer knows her/his total costs. Inquiring about the customer's budget should wait until a later time. Asking about the attendees' sensitivity to cold rooms would indicate a problem to the customer. Inquiring about other hotels being considered would be rude. The sales staff needs to focus on his/her property, services, and costs.

Restaurant wait staff often is able to recommend a substitute menu item when the one requested is not available. Although a restaurant's ultimate goal is to sell food, the recommended substitute item should always satisfy customer needs. A waitperson should not substitute menu items just to make a sale. When customers' needs are met, the customers will probably return to the restaurant to eat. Wait staff should not jeopardize satisfying customers' needs in order to satisfy the business's goals, the suppliers' demands, or the owner's requests.

Hotel employees should inform guests of the hotel's services and amenities during the check-in process. Guests who are not aware that the hotel offers certain services will not use them, which can affect the guests' experience during their stay and can affect the hotel's sales. For example, a guest who does not realize that the hotel has an on-site restaurant will not dine there. As a result, the hotel's food and beverage division loses potential revenue. Advising guests about services during checkout is not beneficial to the guest or to the hotel. Posting is a term that describes adding or subtracting charges to a guest's bill.

For example, if more people are booking airline flights to popular destinations, then they will need lodging, which increases the lodging occupancy rates. If more people need lodging, the hotels need to ensure that they have the resources to accommodate the higher number of guests. If more people are traveling, it is likely that they will spend more money at restaurants and that more people will attend or visit area tour attractions.

Point-of-purchase merchandising appeals to the emotions and visual senses. A window display may get a customer thinking about taking a vacation, thus leading her/him into the agency and initiating immediate feedback. Often, customers who haven't planned to book trips will decide to do so after seeing an agency's window display, thereby making an impulse purchase. If customers have planned to book trips, they may change their minds\u2014 booking trips that cost more than the original trip. Because a display can be used for several months, it can lose impact and effectiveness over along period of time. Displays may stimulate interest in the product, but customers will not purchase if the agent is not responsive or has no other information. Thus, point-of-purchase merchandising usually requires the support of other promotional and/or sales tools. Impulse buying does not generally increase long-term brand loyalty.

In this example, the restaurant is offering lobster dinners for $22.99. A table of four orders the dinners, but two of the customers have coupons for discounts. To process the coupons, the restaurant subtracts the discount amount from the cost of the two dinners. To determine the amount of discount, add the cost of the two dinners and calculate the 15% discount ($22.99 x 2 = $45.98; $45.98 x 15% or .15 = $6.897 or $6.90).

Insurance is a contractual agreement in which one company (insurer) will pay for specified losses incurred by the other company (insured) in return for installment payments (premium). The premium amount is dependent on many factors, including the risk, or chance of loss. For example, a business located near a river that frequently floods is more likely to pay higher property insurance premiums than a business that is not located near a body of water. The insurance company is more likely to pay a claim to the business for flood damages because the chance for flooding is higher. To cover the claim, the insurance company will charge the business high premiums for the policy. Low liability, minimal threats, and good security tend to lower premiums.

Businesses are likely to fail if they do not offer products that customers want. Because customers' needs and wants change over time, hospitality and tourism businesses must collect and monitor marketing information. Knowing what customers want helps businesses develop or adapt products that suit their customers' changing wants and needs. Although hospitality and tourism businesses use technology to acquire marketing information, using technology is not the primary reason for obtaining the marketing information. Businesses can improve their relationships with their creditors by paying their bills. Marketing information can help hospitality and tourism businesses make sound business decisions to increase market share; however, their primary reason for doing so should not be to drive indirect competitors out of business, which may be illegal.

A disadvantage to using Internet surveys is that poorly written questions may be confusing for respondents, which may lead them to answer questions incorrectly because they have no way to obtain clarification.

When making an oral presentation that includes complex research findings, the speaker should use words that help the audience understand the subject matter. The speaker may want to repeat key or major points to reinforce important information. The use of humor depends on the nature of the audience and the topic at hand. Using too much humor or speaking too slowly may irritate some audience members, which in turn may affect their comprehension of the information. SOURCE: IM:391 SOURCE: Bov\u00e9e, C.L., & Thill, J.V.

Promotion involves communicating information about goods, services, images, and/or ideas to achieve a desired outcome. Pricing involves determining and adjusting prices to maximize return and meet customers' perceptions of value. Production is the creation of goods and services. Publicity is any nonpersonal presentation of ideas, goods, or services that is not paid for by the company or individual that benefits from it. SOURCE: MK:001 SOURCE: MK LAP 4\u2014Have It Your Way!

As a result, marketing the industry is highly competitive because there are a wide range of companies that sell travel and tourism services. All of these companies compete for the same customers who have only so much money and time to spend on travel. Advances in technology affect the industry by making it easier for both travel companies and customers to plan vacations and book travel. Travel and tourism is a worldwide industry, although there are local attractions and facilities. Travel and tourism marketing is not controlled by society, although it is affected by what society wants in the way of travel options. SOURCE: MK:013 SOURCE: Morrison, A.M. (2002).

Guest history records usually contain information about guests' home towns, whether the visits were for business or pleasure, how often the guests visited, and who made the reservations. Properties use this information to develop marketing strategies that target the specific populations that are likely to use the lodging facility. If a large percentage of guests were business travelers, the property might develop a marketing plan to target corporations whose employees travel frequently. Properties do not use the information in guest history records to process room accounts, schedule payment plans, or recruit new employees. SOURCE: MP:034 SOURCE: Vallen, G.K., & Vallen, J.J. (2005).

Audio conferencing is a communication method that allows several individuals to simultaneously hold a discussion by telephone. Although each person is in a different location, each person can speak and hear all of the conference participants. Voice mail and facsimile machines are not business tools that allow several people to communicate simultaneously. Typing a text message on the computer or on a cell phone can take time, so it is not as efficient as holding an audio conference. SOURCE: NF:011 SOURCE: InterCall. (n.d.).

The fluctuation of unemployment rates is an economic factor because unemployment has an effect on consumers' ability to buy goods and services. If consumers are unemployed, they do not have income to spend. As a result, businesses do not sell as much because consumers are not buying. When this situation occurs, businesses often reduce expenses in an attempt to stay in business until the rate of employment starts to rise again. Increased regulation is a political factor. Population shift is a demographic factor. Lifestyle adjustment is a cultural factor. SOURCE: NF:015 SOURCE: Farese, L.S., Kimbrell, G., & Woloszyk, C.A. (2006).

Trends indicate that many niche markets are growing. Some of these markets include the baby boomers, health conscious people, and adventure travelers. Adventure travelers include people who enjoy nature and often enjoy taking risks. Adventure travelers enjoy activities such as skydiving, mountain biking, and race car driving. Geotourism (or environmental tourism) refers to a market that is interested in unique or threatened outdoor environments, such as the rainforest.

Businesses usually develop procedures and policies for employees to follow in order to maintain a safe work environment. One policy might involve the type of clothing that employees are permitted to wear on the job. Depending on the type of work, employees may be required to wear certain types of shoes or clothing that cover their arms and legs. Employees may not be allowed to wear clothing that might get tangled up in equipment. The intent is to keep the work environment safe for employees. Businesses do not require employees to wear appropriate clothing to maintain a comfortable atmosphere, an industrial image, or a sanitary facility. SOURCE: OP:008 SOURCE: Redman, B., & Richards, W.

Fraud is deceiving or cheating an individual or a business out of money or property. Businesses usually instruct employees to check the status of credit cards, the card's expiration date, and the signature on the back of the card. Employees should make sure that the signature on the charge receipt matches the signature on the back of the credit card. Pilferage is theft of small sums of money or inexpensive items. Robbery is theft that involves the use of force, violence, or fear. Burglary is any illegal entry into a building to commit a theft. SOURCE: OP:013 SOURCE: Kimiecik, R.C., & Thomas, C. (2006).

Before you can identify the right people, you need to decide what skills are needed. For example, do you need people to use hand tools or lift heavy boxes?

For example, a company uses raw materials, equipment, employees, and a building to produce radios for purchase by other businesses for use or for resale. Management is the process of coordinating resources in order to accomplish an organization's goals. Accounting is the process of keeping financial records.

Employees need to accomplish as much as possible while on the job rather than just putting in their hours. One way they can do this is by meeting deadlines so they don't hold up co-workers' projects or disappoint customers. Meeting deadlines helps to control expenses by eliminating the need for overtime or additional work in order to complete projects. Employees who read magazines, take long breaks, and leave early cost a business additional money in lost time. SOURCE: OP:025 SOURCE: Think Big. (2009, April 29).

C Accounts payable. Accounts payable refers to all monies owed by the business to others. Many companies have departments that handle all of the bills (accounts payable) that the companies need to pay. When a project requires the input of several outside sources, there are usually many bills associated with the project. To make sure that the projected budget amounts match the actual bills, the project manager may request copies of the invoices from the accounts payable department to review the invoices for discrepancies. The sales, inventory control, and service departments do not handle accounts payable. SOURCE: OP:184 SOURCE: Eggland, S.A., Dlabay, L.R., & Burrow, J.L. (2004). Intro to business (5th ed.) [p.186].

Businesses often have programs that call for the inspection of each area on a regular basis. For example, the lights may be checked weekly while the heating and cooling system is inspected twice a year. By continually inspecting equipment and facilities, a business is able to prevent many breakdowns from occurring. Continual inspection may identify problems with housekeeping, landscaping, and security that the business would then be able to correct. SOURCE: OP:032 SOURCE: Stutts, A.T., & Wortman, J.F. (2006).

The most important thing to do is to try to stay calm and not do anything that might anger the robber. By angering the robber, the event may escalate into a situation where someone gets hurt. For example, attempting to write down the description of the robber, refusing to cooperate or follow instructions, or attempting to distract or overtake the robber while the robbery is in process might anger the robber and result in serious injury. When the robber leaves the premises, the police should be called and a physical description of the robber should be detailed in a written format. Many businesses have hidden or quiet alarm systems located on the premises. Employees should be carefully trained to use the silent alarm system in the event of a robbery.

These offer excellent security for hotel guests as they do not contain a hotel room number, so that if one is lost or stolen it cannot be easily traced. Metal detectors are used in airports to check passengers entering boarding areas.

Individuals are frequently judged by others on the basis of first impressions or the image they project. Good posture has a positive effect on the image people project to others, and sitting up straight is an example of good posture. Using slang will not create a favorable impression.

Price in the hospitality industry is the amount that guests pay for the primary services provided by a property. In most situations, the price is the amount guests pay for one night's lodging. However, in the case of an all-inclusive resort, price is the amount a guest pays for one night's lodging which also includes a variety of extras such as meals and beverages. An all-inclusive price is often appealing to guests because they think they are getting a bargain. Price in the hospitality industry usually does not include dinner in the main dining room, transportation, or sightseeing trips. These services are often included in a total vacation package that is often provided by the travel and tourism industry.

The image of products reinforces a business's image. Ideally, the core values of the business and its products should be the same or compatible. For example, exhibiting social responsibility is a core value. Businesses project this value in their products by making products that are safe. Communicating the core value of product safety also reinforces the business's image of being socially responsible. Communicating the core values of products is not an effective way to explain the price structure, analyze the sales operation, or create a distribution channel.

A hospitality business might add an item (e.g., suite hotels) to its existing product line to appeal to a broader audience. A traditional hotel business might add suite hotels to its product line to attract guests who have large families and need more room, or to appeal to travelers who are staying longer than the typical transient guests. Acquiring assistance from outside organizations or consultants to obtain goods or services to accomplish business objectives is known as outsourcing.

The banner advertisements interact with users by providing information and allowing users to respond to the information by linking to other information or sites.

Color harmonies are the ways in which colors are combined on the page to create a sense of visual order and appeal. Colors tend to trigger certain feelings in people. Because the color red attracts the most attention visually, it tends to generate intense emotion and energy. Yellow also attracts attention and tends to be an \u201coptimistic\u201d color. Because yellow is hard on the eyes, it should be used sparingly. Orange is a mixture of red and yellow and often generates feelings of enthusiasm and warmth.

After the graphic, the headline is the next element of an advertisement the audience scans. A well-written headline is short and memorable, and it encourages the audience to read the advertising copy. An effective headline also indicates how the product will benefit the reader. For example, a Tide laundry detergent advertisement contained a headline stating, \u201dJust when you thought laundry couldn't get any more fun.\u201d The benefit of using Tide is having fun while doing laundry.

All kinds of mistakes are possible in print ads. The firm paying for the ad should make sure that its name and, in some cases, its address appear correctly in the ad so that consumers who read the ad will be able to identify the business. The business might also include a telephone number and hours of business operation with the business identification, and this information should be checked for accuracy. Questions as to how long an ad will run, what media will present it, and how it compares with competitors' ads would be answered before a final proof of the ad is prepared.

A Placing tropical-themed tent cards on each table. Full-service restaurants often develop seasonal menus. A Caribbean summer menu might consist of fresh fruits, seasonal vegetables, and flavorful seafood and chicken entrees. Because the Caribbean Islands are a tropical location, the restaurant might place tropical-themed tent cards on the tables to promote the new menu items. Sending a newsletter to trade publications would not be a way to prepare the restaurant for the premier of a new summer menu. Employees might be required to wear tropical shirts and shorts rather than red sweaters. It would better follow the tropical theme if the restaurant were to hire a reggae band rather than a jazz musician. SOURCE: PR:068 SOURCE: Mill, R.C. (2001).

Promotion is the element of marketing that involves communicating and sending messages to inform, persuade, or remind customers of a travel and tourism business's products. An online travel business that sends an e-mail about a special product offer is using promotion. Product/Service management is a marketing function that involves obtaining, developing, maintaining, and improving a product or service mix in response to market opportunities. Operations management is the process of planning, controlling, and monitoring the day-to-day activities required for continued business functioning. Distribution is an aspect of operations.

Package plans are often promoted as mini-vacations because they combine lodging and certain amenities at a discounted price. A corporate rate is a commercial rate offered to businesses. The rack rate is the regular room rate. An incentive rate is one offered to other employees of the hospitality industry, e.g., travel agents, to encourage referrals.

A Sombrero, poster of Cancun, beach towel, and sunglasses. A travel agency that is running a special offer for Mexican beach destinations is likely to display items that relate to the beach and to the Mexican culture. Therefore, the travel agency is most likely to display \u201cbeach\u201d items such as sunscreen, sunglasses, beach towels, or even a model of a sailboat. It would also display items that relate to the Mexican culture, such as maracas (hand-held shaking instrument), a sombrero (hat), and a poster of Cancun, which is a popular beach destination in Mexico. Athens is a city in Greece, the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, France, and the Bahamas are part of the Caribbean Islands. The travel agency would not display materials for these destinations when it is promoting beach destinations in Mexico. SOURCE: PR:162 SOURCE: Farese, L.S., Kimbrell, G., & Woloszyk, C.A. (2009).

Test 1046 HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM CLUSTER EXAM 29 95. D Use pauses between questions. Pausing is an effective technique that enables the customer to absorb all the information and to ask questions. Customers should be encouraged to ask questions and made to feel that their questions are important. Personal questions, such as \"How much can you afford to spend?\" are inappropriate. When stock is limited, fewer questions are needed to narrow the choices for the customer. SOURCE: SE:111 SOURCE: Futrell, C.M. (2006). Fundamentals of selling: Customers for life through service (9th ed.) [p. 326]. New York: McGraw-Hill/Irwin. 96. D Recommend a substitute. Sometimes salespeople sell substitute items when they know that a substitute item will meet the customer's true needs better than the requested product. By determining a customer's needs, a salesperson may learn that a product of greater or lesser value might meet the customer's needs better than the item originally requested. After recommending a substitute product, a salesperson might demonstrate the item to the customer. A salesperson questions and listens to a customer to determine the customer's needs before recommending a substitute product. Salespeople should be prepared to answer questions or respond to objections when substitute selling. SOURCE: SE:114 SOURCE: Greene, C. (2003). Selling: Business 2000 (p. 149).

D To address their needs. Before salespeople can decide which selling technique to use to sell goods or services to customers, they need to find out something about the customers. Each customer has a different need and responds differently to various selling techniques. Effective salespeople obtain information about customers in order to determine their needs and to use the most appropriate selling technique to satisfy those needs. Salespeople often make conversation and ask for information in an attempt to find out something about their customers. Salespeople usually do not expect to develop personal relationships with their customers. SOURCE: SE:046 SOURCE: Futrell, C.M. (2006). Fundamentals of selling: Customers for life through service (9th ed.) [pp. 258-259, 264-265]. New York: McGraw-Hill/Irwin. 99. D Recommendations of friends. People often rely heavily on the recommendations of friends, relatives, and associates when choosing travel destinations. When friends share information about good experiences on cruise ships or on escorted tours, they often encourage each other to take similar trips. People may assume that they and their friends have similar likes and dislikes and would enjoy the same travel destinations. People usually do not select a destination if their friends had a bad experience and do not recommend it. People are not motivated to choose travel destinations because of the methods of promotion, actions of competitors, or level of maintenance.

For example, in the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulates air-transportation functions (i.e., airspace, aircraft safety); the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) handles issues related to personal and business taxes; and the Federal Commerce Commission (FCC) handles issues related to business and commerce. The legislative branch of government introduces and passes statutes. The judicial branch of government (court systems) interprets the law.

Since there are no laws to protect the travel consumer from overbooking, bumping passengers from flights is common when traveling by air.

The amount a passenger is compensated for lost luggage is subject to negotiation. Most airlines have a ceiling on the amount paid ($2,500/passenger); international travelers are paid $9.07/lb. Currently, there is no international \"Bill of Rights.\" The United States Congress has developed several options for an airline passenger \"Bill of Rights,\" but there is nothing on the law books as of yet (August, 2009).

Channel members, which are all of the individuals and businesses that assist in moving products from the producer to the end user, depend on each other to perform activities leading to customer satisfaction. While it is important to have products when and where they are needed, it is also important to remember that customers often have different ideas about service. For example, one customer may not accept a substitution for a certain item or brand because they are concerned about quality, while another customer may want the item quickly and will accept the substitution. Each customer has different expectations, so each customer defines service differently. Expecting low service levels, wanting immediate delivery, and refusing late shipments are different factors that influence how customers define service.

A business's peak selling season occurs when customer demand for certain goods and services is very high. For example, the demand for beachwear and outdoor furniture is usually highest during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere. Therefore, businesses generally try to order these types of items so they have enough on hand to meet demand. Some types of businesses (e.g., resort gift shops) carry similar items need them at the same time, so vendors and manufacturers might need more lead time to fill orders. Although businesses might purchase small quantities of the item on a frequent basis, they run a risk of back-order situations from their suppliers and, therefore, cannot meet customer demand.

There are several strategies that copywriters can use to develop advertising copy. One of these is the factual strategy that involves explaining what a product is, what it does, and how it benefits consumers.

For example, factual copy might state that a cell phone weighs less than one pound, is made of scratchresistant material, and can be programmed to hold 500 numbers. The imaginative strategy would focus on explaining new and unusual ways to use a product. The emotional strategy appeals to consumers on a personal level and focuses on their feelings, such as love and loyalty.

A leisure traveler might select a beachfront resort hotel over a nearby roadside motel because it might offer more amenities geared to vacationers. A trucker, on the other hand, might select the roadside motel because of its easy access to the highway. Positioning strategies are methods that members of the hospitality industry use to create a particular image or standing in the marketplace. Although hotels use positioning strategies to appeal to customers, customers do not generally consider the specific techniques that businesses use to position products.

The online travel agencies are successful because they can bring more value to consumers than many traditional brick-and-mortar travel agencies. A discrepancy of assortment is a difference between the product lines that a firm offers and the assortment of products that the consumer wants.

Although privacy policies vary by business, they might include limiting the access that employees have to customer information and refusing to sell customer lists to third parties. If customers feel that the business respects their privacy, they are more likely to trust the business and become loyal customers. Loyal customers provide the business with repeat sales.

Positioning is a product mix strategy in which a business creates a certain image or impression of a product in the minds of consumers. In most cases, businesses want the image of the new product to match the business's image and the image of its other products.

It would confuse customers if a business with a low-cost image positioned a new product as expensive or exclusive. Also, customers might not buy an expensive new product from a business with a low-cost image. Promotional pricing is pricing goods/services at low levels and advertising them heavily.

Promotion is a critical consideration when introducing a new product because this function lets channel members and customers know that the good or service is available. The promotional efforts should be carefully planned and coordinated with the product's release. For example, a manufacturer might provide catalogs, brochures, coop-advertising funds, and product training to its intermediaries (e.g., dealers, wholesalers) before the product is released so that the intermediaries can explain the products to their customers or end users. Some channel members (e.g., retailers) might need to coordinate promotion so that newspaper and television advertising or special events are appropriately timed with the product's arrival on the stores' shelves.

By acknowledging the objections and providing a rationale that removes the objections, the writers better position themselves in persuading the readers to take specific actions.

Although collaboration and cooperation among individuals can be used to achieve a common goal, groupthink conditions can be detrimental to ethical decision making. Groupthink is an extreme form of cohesiveness in which all members of the group strive for unanimity (harmony) at any cost. This condition stifles independent thinking and objectivity. Group members who question another member's idea or action may be censored or cut off by the group majority. In addition, individuals begin to self-censor, which means they quiet their own conflicting thoughts for the \"good of the group.\" Groupthink can erode personal ethics and lead group members to do things they normally wouldn't do.

Tourists are often easy to identify because of the way they dress and behave and because of the sites and attractions they visit. For example, tourists in certain parts of the world are easily recognized because they do not look like the local people, and they do not speak the language. Furthermore, the perception often is that tourists carry a lot of money and are not particularly careful. Also, tourists may not be aware of high-crime districts and accidentally walk into those areas. All of these factors set up tourists as targets of crime. As a result, the travel and tourism industry stresses security and tries to prepare tourists for possible problems. For example, tour operators may point out areas of cities that the group should avoid, or cruise ships might tell passengers to use only certain taxis in ports of call. Tourists are not looking for trouble, nor are they any more prone to injury than other people. Many tourists travel only with family members rather than as part of a group.

Members of groups, conventions, and organization affiliations (e.g., AAA) often obtain discounts from hotels. Travelers who regularly frequent a specific hotel receive discounts. Therefore, price varies and is affected by the demand for and supply of rooms at any given time. Because rates change often, hotels must manage the price function carefully.

One way governments can support start-up businesses is to make it easier to conduct business by having fewer rules that restrict trade with other companies or countries. Another way governments can support entrepreneurship is by reducing tax obligations for small-business start-ups. Entrepreneurs can use the tax savings to build the business. Ethical standards refer to the unwritten rules that govern each individual's behavior. Exhibiting ethical behavior might enhance one's chances for success in business but does not necessarily encourage entrepreneurial development. Increased interest rates on loans indicate that the business owner is paying more money to start the company. Some entrepreneurs might not feel that they can afford the loan amount and decide not to start the business. Therefore, the higher interest rates do not encourage entrepreneurial growth. Governments that pass laws with strict trade guidelines reduce the ability for free trade, thereby discouraging entrepreneurship.

These markets can create a variety of problems for the brand's owner. They can damage channel member relationships, diminish a brand's value, harm a company's reputation, and damage a company's segmented pricing activities. Because of these issues, a brand's owner needs to take action to overcome or at least limit the gray-market activity.

Only a small number of dissatisfied customers actually take the time to complain to a business. Instead, they typically tell everyone they know about their bad experience, which can mean a lot of negative publicity for a company that didn't even get a chance to correct the problem. When a customer complains, s/he gives a business the opportunity to fix its mistakes. If a company handles the situation right, it can create a loyal customer. A company should never attempt to tell a customer s/he is wrong, even if s/he is. Instead, the person handling the complaint should listen and empathize with the customer. Fewer customer complaints may save a company time and frustration in the short term, but in the long term they can end up costing money. When customers complain about products or services, they alert a company to possible problems. A company can then fix those problems early on and avoid expensive fixes down the road.

Businesses establish different types of security procedures to protect their assets\u2014equipment, inventory, facilities, money, information, and employees. Businesses need to communicate these security procedures to employees so the employees know what they need to do to maintain a secure work environment. If employees do not follow security procedures, the risk of security breaches occurring increases. For example, an employee who does not properly lock the cash drawer increases the risk of robbery. If employees fail to lock the warehouse doors at the end of business hours, the risk of theft increases. If a security breach occurs, the business may experience financial losses (e.g., stolen money, goods, and equipment). Employees follow safety procedures to reduce the risk of accidents in the workplace.

Therefore, tourists should use tour companies that are approved or recommended by the cruise line. This recommendation also applies to any transportation service (e.g., bus or taxi).

A business that temporarily increases prices for goods (e.g., lumber, milk, medicine) during a crisis is behaving in an unethical and, in many jurisdictions, an illegal manner. When a business engages in price gouging activities, it runs the risk of losing credibility with the public, which can result in a poor image or damaged reputation.

The price of the bundled products is usually lower than the combined price of the products sold separately. The lower price provides the travel client with an incentive to buy. The odd pricing strategy involves setting selling prices below even-dollar amounts to suggest a bargain. Prestige pricing involves deliberately putting an artificially high price on a good or service to suggest high quality and status.

Air transportation is regulated by specific government agencies. Airports and airlines are required to abide by regulations concerning safety, routes, passenger rights, etc. Due to an increased concern about terrorism, airports have increased their security measures to reduce the risk of potential terrorists accessing airplanes as passengers. These measures include luggage and clothing inspections, pat downs, and body scanners to detect weapons that a person might have.

Businesses coordinate channel management with their promotional activities to make sure that sufficient quantities of products are available when they are needed for an advertised sale. If a business plans to promote a certain product or offer it at a special price, the business must make sure that an adequate supply will be on hand to meet consumer demand.

Regardless of whether you are writing a report, preparing for a debate, or simply learning something new for the fun of it, identifying and reading sources that provide relevant, valid information about the subject at hand is very important. If you don't use relevant, valid information, you may write, say, or learn something that is misleading or untrue. A number of criteria are commonly used to determine if certain written materials are relevant and valid. These criteria include the author's credibility, the date of publication, the publisher, etc. For instance, if you are researching federal legislation such as copyright law, you are most likely to read relevant, valid information in government publications. The government writes and enforces copyright law and other federal legislation, so government publications about these laws are most likely to be timely, accurate, complete, and on topic. People commonly express their opinions, not facts, in online discussion forums.

The search engines themselves do not contain information about federal legislation; they direct you to other web sites\u2014some good and some not so good\u2014about federal legislation such as copyright law.

Colleagues who build collaborative partnerships with each other do not have to have similar jobs, skills, and areas of expertise. In fact, many colleagues who work in different industries or have different strengths and weaknesses build successful, mutually beneficial relationships. The cost and length of the partnership does not necessarily have a direct impact on the partnership's success. Colleagues can live in different geographic areas and still maintain successful collaborative partnerships by using any of the many advanced communication technologies available today.

A credit union is a nonprofit financial cooperative set up to provide savings and credit services to its members, who are also the owners of the credit union. Although many credit unions are tied to a particular business or labor union, some are not affiliated with any certain entity or organization.

A commercial bank is a full-service bank offering a variety of banking services including checking and savings accounts, secured and unsecured loans, installment credit, and bank credit cards. While an insurance company may offer some banking services, it is likely to focus on the sale of insurance policies to individuals and businesses. A savings and loan association is a financial institution that offers savings accounts and makes loans to borrowers, most of which are for real-estate purchases.

Frugging is a practice in which marketers deliberately mislead consumers by stating that they are collecting marketing research, when they are really soliciting donations. Lodging facilities do not install Internet firewalls to protect their confidential information from binary users, frugging activities, and web rings. SOURCE: OP:064 SOURCE: Kurtz, D.L. (2009).

The turnover rates can reveal which items are popular and which items are not selling well. If the items are moving slowly, the turnover rate will be low.

Concessions are terms that the business is willing to give up. For example, the business's optimal quantity discount is 15%, but it is willing to give up 3% and settle for a 12% discount.

Showing a video that features England's tourist attractions (e.g., Buckingham Palace and the Tower of London) may stimulate interest in visiting England and encourage customers to book the tour. The Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum are in France, so it is unlikely that the travel agency would feature these sites in a display to promote a tour of England. A cardboard cutout of Mickey Mouse and Cinderella in front of the Magic Kingdom is an appropriate display item to promote a trip to Disneyland or Disney World. A travel agency would likely use a sombrero, beach towel, colorful balloons and a poster of a tropical beach resort in a display promoting travel to Mexico.
