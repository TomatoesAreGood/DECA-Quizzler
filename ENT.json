When a business becomes a public corporation, it must follow strict government rules and regulations, including forming a board of directors to guide the corporation.

The Delphi sales-forecasting method can take a lot of time; therefore, it is expensive. The survey of buyer intentions sales forecasting method is not always accurate since customers sometimes can't make accurate predictions of their buying intentions.

It is important to track the performance of a business plan to determine if the objective of the business is being met. A main objective for most businesses is to sell products. By tracking the performance of the strategies outlined in the business plan, a business is able to find out if the strategies it is using to sell are effective. If the business is not satisfied with the level of sales, it might develop different strategies. Developing a business plan involves establishing an operating strategy and determining the proposed mission of the company. Businesses often use a business plan to provide investment information to potential investors. SOURCE: SM:006 SOURCE: Berry, T. (2017, May 12).

When businesses obtain insurance coverage, they try to find insurance that best meets their needs at a reasonable price. In order to do this, businesses need to consider the value of the property they are insuring. If property has a low value, it may be more economical to pay to replace it than to pay high yearly premiums. For example, paying $500 a year to insure property that is worth $2,000 is a waste of money because only a few years of premiums would pay for a replacement. Most businesses insure property that is essential to the operation of the business and property that increases in value, because replacement is often expensive. A yearly premium of $1,000 for liability coverage of $100,000 is inexpensive. SOURCE: FI:082 SOURCE: Business Filings. (2012, May 24).

When a buyer uses multiple suppliers, s/he gains more negotiation power to obtain lower supply prices, thereby reducing the cost of a company's products. In addition to the cost of supplies purchased, the labor and time required to produce products also impact product cost.

Relying on one supplier can result in supply interruptions, which can cause a loss in production time and an increase in production costs.
