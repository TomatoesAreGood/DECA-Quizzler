Traditionally, disintermediation has involved the elimination of intermediaries or middlemen like Kathy. This results in the transfer of products directly from producers (in this case, airlines) to the ultimate consumer. More broadly, though, disintermediation can include the displacement of traditional intermediaries with new, radically different types of intermediaries such as online travel agencies. The online travel agencies are successful because they can bring more value to consumers than many traditional brick-and-mortar travel agencies. A discrepancy of assortment is a difference between the product lines that a firm offers and the assortment of products that the consumer wants. Bulk-breaking involves dividing large quantities of products into smaller quantities as products move from the producer to middlemen to consumers. There is no indication that bulk-breaking is occurring. Exclusive distribution involves selling products through only one intermediary in a certain geographic area. Since more than one firm is selling airline tickets in the geographic area, exclusive distribution is not taking place. SOURCE: CM:006 SOURCE: Kotler, P., Bowen, J.T., & Makens, J.C. (2010).

The activity could then be publicized in a press release on the restaurant's website and/or in the local newspaper. Buying books and uniforms are also worthy causes but are not as good a fit as feeding the homeless. Many late-night airport arrivals are going to their homes. Also, there are usually a number of fast-food restaurants located adjacent to the airport that could meet the needs of that group. SOURCE: PR:347 SOURCE: Kotler, P., Bowen, J.T., Makens, J.C. (2010).

Apply for a line of credit"], "answer": "B", "reasoning": "Use appropriate promotional techniques to inform channel members. Promotion is a critical consideration when introducing a new product because this function lets channel members and customers know that the good or service is available. The promotional efforts should be carefully planned and coordinated with the product's release. For example, a manufacturer might provide catalogs, brochures, coop-advertising funds, and product training to its intermediaries (e.g., dealers, wholesalers) before the product is released so that the intermediaries can explain the products to their customers or end users. Some channel members (e.g., retailers) might need to coordinate promotion so that newspaper and television advertising or special events are appropriately timed with the product's arrival on the stores' shelves. If the communication between a manufacturer and its intermediaries is already very good, the manufacturer needs to continue using good communication rather than improve it. Applying for a line of credit is a financial consideration. Ethics policies must not only be established, but they must communicated to the appropriate people or organizations.

Although collaboration and cooperation among individuals can be used to achieve a common goal, groupthink conditions can be detrimental to ethical decision making. Groupthink is an extreme form of cohesiveness in which all members of the group strive for unanimity (harmony) at any cost. This condition stifles independent thinking and objectivity. Group members who question another member's idea or action may be censored or cut off by the group majority. In addition, individuals begin to self-censor, which means they quiet their own conflicting thoughts for the \"good of the group.\" Groupthink can erode personal ethics and lead group members to do things they normally wouldn't do. In today's competitive business environment, the pressure to earn high profits has often resulted in fraudulent behavior, embezzlement, money laundering, etc. Such actions are often a result of groupthink conditions.

Tourists are often easy to identify because of the way they dress and behave and because of the sites and attractions they visit. For example, tourists in certain parts of the world are easily recognized because they do not look like the local people, and they do not speak the language. Furthermore, the perception often is that tourists carry a lot of money and are not particularly careful. Also, tourists may not be aware of high-crime districts and accidentally walk into those areas. All of these factors set up tourists as targets of crime. As a result, the travel and tourism industry stresses security and tries to prepare tourists for possible problems. For example, tour operators may point out areas of cities that the group should avoid, or cruise ships might tell passengers to use only certain taxis in ports of call. Tourists are not looking for trouble, nor are they any more prone to injury than other people. Many tourists travel only with family members rather than as part of a group.

Members of groups, conventions, and organization affiliations (e.g., AAA) often obtain discounts from hotels. Travelers who regularly frequent a specific hotel receive discounts.

In this example, the restaurant is offering lobster dinners for $22.99. A table of four orders the dinners, but two of the customers have coupons for discounts. To process the coupons, the restaurant subtracts the discount amount from the cost of the two dinners. To determine the amount of discount, add the cost of the two dinners and calculate the 15% discount ($22.99 x 2 = $45.98; $45.98 x 15% or .15 = $6.897 or $6.90).

An invoice (bill) documents how much a customer or client owes for the goods or services a business provides. To operate, a business orders office supplies, outsources services (e.g., legal advice), leases equipment, etc. Its vendors send the business bills (invoices) that state how much the business owes. The business monitors and tracks the invoices to make sure it is billed correctly. If the business finds a discrepancy (e.g., incorrect tax amount) on a bill, the business will likely contact the vendor to make necessary adjustments. Tracking invoices is one way the business controls its expenses. Accounts receivable are the monies coming into the business.

When businesses buy goods from foreign countries, they should take into consideration the length of time it will take to ship the goods. Making shipping arrangements in foreign countries can be complicated; therefore, it is usually necessary to place orders early. Businesses often need to allow adequate time to apply for special shipping permits and pay various fees to foreign governments before the ordered goods can be shipped. Selling policies, display requirements, and receiving facilities are not factors that businesses consider when determining when to buy goods from foreign countries.

One way governments can support start-up businesses is to make it easier to conduct business by having fewer rules that restrict trade with other companies or countries. Another way governments can support entrepreneurship is by reducing tax obligations for small-business start-ups. Entrepreneurs can use the tax savings to build the business. Ethical standards refer to the unwritten rules that govern each individual's behavior. Exhibiting ethical behavior might enhance one's chances for success in business but does not necessarily encourage entrepreneurial development. Increased interest rates on loans indicate that the business owner is paying more money to start the company. Some entrepreneurs might not feel that they can afford the loan amount and decide not to start the business. Therefore, the higher interest rates do not encourage entrepreneurial growth. Governments that pass laws with strict trade guidelines reduce the ability for free trade, thereby discouraging entrepreneurship.

These markets can create a variety of problems for the brand's owner.

Because of these issues, a brand's owner needs to take action to overcome or at least limit the gray-market activity.

Only a small number of dissatisfied customers actually take the time to complain to a business. Instead, they typically tell everyone they know about their bad experience, which can mean a lot of negative publicity for a company that didn't even get a chance to correct the problem. When a customer complains, s/he gives a business the opportunity to fix its mistakes. If a company handles the situation right, it can create a loyal customer. A company should never attempt to tell a customer s/he is wrong, even if s/he is. Instead, the person handling the complaint should listen and empathize with the customer. Fewer customer complaints may save a company time and frustration in the short term, but in the long term they can end up costing money. When customers complain about products or services, they alert a company to possible problems. A company can then fix those problems early on and avoid expensive fixes down the road.

Businesses establish different types of security procedures to protect their assets\u2014equipment, inventory, facilities, money, information, and employees. Businesses need to communicate these security procedures to employees so the employees know what they need to do to maintain a secure work environment. If employees do not follow security procedures, the risk of security breaches occurring increases. For example, an employee who does not properly lock the cash drawer increases the risk of robbery. If employees fail to lock the warehouse doors at the end of business hours, the risk of theft increases. If a security breach occurs, the business may experience financial losses (e.g., stolen money, goods, and equipment).

When a business engages in price gouging activities, it runs the risk of losing credibility with the public, which can result in a poor image or damaged reputation.

Tour and travel businesses often bundle travel products (e.g., airfare, hotel accommodations, rental car) to encourage clients to buy travel products that they otherwise might not purchase. The price of the bundled products is usually lower than the combined price of the products sold separately. The lower price provides the travel client with an incentive to buy. The odd pricing strategy involves setting selling prices below even-dollar amounts to suggest a bargain. Prestige pricing involves deliberately putting an artificially high price on a good or service to suggest high quality and status.
