One way that employees can do this is by not taking anything belonging to the business for their personal use. This can range from not making personal use of company vehicles to not taking home pens and pencils. Businesses must replace the company property that employees take for their own use, which results in additional expense for the business. Taking the initiative to find work, reporting incidents of shoplifting, and giving appropriate discounts to customers are ways that employees can help control expenses.

The advantage of using new technology in the distribution function is that it saves time. The use of computerized inventory systems allows businesses to keep track of exactly how much inventory is in stock at any one time, and the use of electronic data processing allows businesses to place orders electronically, which shortens the order cycles. The new technology allows businesses to communicate instantly, place orders when needed, and receive the goods quickly. This reduces the amount of inventory they need to carry because they can quickly obtain whatever they need. The technology also helps to increase turnover by identifying excess inventory that should be marked down in order to sell. Increased overhead would be a disadvantage to businesses.

A slotting allowance refers to a fee paid by a manufacturer or vendor to a customer, usually a retailer. This fee is charged to cover the costs for placing a new product on the retailer's shelves. By charging a slotting allowance, the customer is trying to cover the costs of stocking and maintaining the product. If a new product does not sell well, the fees can help to cover the time on the shelf that could have been used for a higher moving item. Since there is only a limited amount of shelf space in a supermarket, the implementation of a slotting allowance does not necessarily increase a store's product line.

Public sentiment is forcing these companies to address environmental issues, such as pollution. The businesses that fail to do their part to protect the environment often anger consumers, which may lead to a loss of sales.
