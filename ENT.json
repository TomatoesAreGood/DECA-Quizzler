When a business becomes a public corporation, it must follow strict government rules and regulations, including forming a board of directors to guide the corporation.

If the business is not satisfied with the level of sales, it might develop different strategies. Developing a business plan involves establishing an operating strategy and determining the proposed mission of the company. Businesses often use a business plan to provide investment information to potential investors. SOURCE: SM:006 SOURCE: Berry, T. (2017, May 12).

There are many ways for entrepreneurs to obtain financing for new business ventures. One way is to obtain a loan from a commercial bank. The loan process generally involves completing a loan application and submitting a business plan to the financial institution. In most situations, a bank will require the loan applicant to put up collateral in order to obtain the loan. Collateral is anything of value (e.g., car, home) belonging to the borrower that is pledged to the lender to guarantee that the loan will be repaid. For example, if a business fails, and the borrower cannot afford to pay back the bank loan, the bank can take the borrower's belongings (collateral) as payment for the outstanding loan. Banks do not require loan applicants to close their savings accounts, relinquish contracts, or charge interest. SOURCE: EN:015 SOURCE: Hall, A.

Direct marketing is a form of promotion that directly communicates with members of the target market. Two channels that businesses commonly use to communicate directly with customers are email and traditional postal mail. Both of these direct-marketing methods provide the business with the ability to customize the message or offer to appeal to the message recipient. For example, an online business might have a customer's personal product preferences stored in its database. When a customer's favorite products go on sale, the business can send email messages to the customer to let him/her know about the promotion. This form of direct marketing is a way to connect and build long-term relationships with customers. Customized messages do not appeal to a mass audience. A business cannot assume that the majority of message recipients will respond to a direct-marketing message.

Aligning key performance indicators with business goals and objectives can help an organization stay focused on the aspects of the business that are most important to it. Key performance indicators are not necessarily aligned with a business's operating expenses, corporate culture, or payroll and benefits.

Venture harvesting is the stage in the entrepreneurial process in which the entrepreneur exits the business and collects (harvests) his/her share of the venture investment. There are many ways to harvest a venture, including closing the business entirely, selling the business to another person or company, keeping the business intact and releasing cash flows, and taking the company \"public\" through an IPO (initial public offering). IPO means that the entrepreneur is selling stock to the public and giving up control of some or all of the business; over time, the venture becomes a public corporation. By incorporating the business, the owner is selling stock, which generates money so the company can continue and grow. Ceasing business operations means that the business cannot grow, because it is closed.

Cash flow is an important part of a business's capacity to repay a loan, which is one of the criteria that banks use when evaluating loan applications. Therefore, a business's cash flow is usually the primary source for repaying the loan. If a business has sufficient cash flow, banks usually are more willing to loan money because there are funds available to repay the debt. Fixed assets are items of value a business owns that are not expected to change, such as a building. Fixed assets might be a secondary source because they can be sold to repay a loan.

Television and radio commercials and newspaper and magazine advertisements are examples of mass communication, which consists of nonpersonal promotional messages. The function of business designed to establish good relations between the business and the public is public relations. SOURCE: PR:089 Explain the nature of direct marketing channels SOURCE: Lesko, B.

Trade advertising and trade shows"], "answer": "D", "reasoning": "Trade advertising and trade shows. Sales promotion encompasses promotional activities other than advertising, personal selling, and publicity. Depending on their target markets, businesses use different types of sales-promotion strategies to stimulate sales. When a business uses the push sales-promotion strategy, it is attempting to move or push the product through the distribution channel to the end user. To do this, businesses use sales-promotion techniques (e.g., discount coupons and rebates) to provide channel members with incentives to sell the products to their customers, who are often the end users. Businesses often use trade advertising and trade shows to inform channel members about their products and sales promotions. If a business uses a pull strategy, it is likely to use mass advertising communication channels (e.g., national television commercials) to reach the target market. Pricing is a marketing function that involves determining and adjusting prices to maximize returns and to meet customers' perceptions of value.

There are two general approaches to remedial action that supervisors can use: preventive and corrective. Preventive discipline is essentially an approach to managing people in such a way that behaviors which would require discipline are prevented. One action that supervisors can use to prevent discipline problems is open-door management: a policy permitting employees to voice their complaints, grievances, or problems to successively higher levels of management. Corrective discipline is intended to discourage further violations after infractions have already occurred. It may consist of one or several forms of action, including progressive discipline, corrective counseling, and constructive criticism.

Then, divide the projected increase in dollars by the current year's royalty revenues to obtain the projected increase percentage of royalty revenue ($148,977.50 / $425,650.00 = .35 = 35%).

To build and maintain customer relationships, a company's brand promise should strive to create positive experiences for customers\u2014experiences that will encourage them to return to the business again and again. Companies use various touchpoints to create these experiences for their customers. Touchpoints are all of the opportunities that a company has to connect with its customers and reinforce its brand value. Touchpoints may include the company's employees, product attributes and packaging, and technological systems (e.g., phone, website). A slogan (tag line) is a phrase that is easy to remember, such as \"Nationwide is on your side.\" A trade character is a symbol that is personified (e.g., Tony the Tiger). Businesses often use slogans and trade characters as elements of their brands. Changing slogans frequently or developing different trade characters may confuse customers, which may reduce brand recognition. One reason that businesses establish certain types of policies (e.g., sales, service) is to ensure that customers are treated fairly. Establishing different policies for different customers is not treating customers fairly, and in some circumstances, such actions are illegal.

Rent the furniture because rental costs will be less than the purchase price for 3.4 years."], "answer": "B", "reasoning": "Buy the furniture because rental costs will exceed the purchase price in 1.97 years. To determine whether to rent or buy office furniture, the small-business owner needs to first calculate the annual cost of renting the furniture. To do this, multiply the monthly rate of $275 by the number of employees needing furniture (6). This provides the total monthly rental expense: $275 X 6 = $1,650. Next, multiply the total monthly rental expense by 12, the number of months in a year: $1,650 X 12 = $19,800. Now, determine how much the small-business owner would pay if they bought the furniture. Multiply the furniture cost per person by the number of people needing furniture: $6,500 X 6 = $39,000. Finally, divide the furniture's total cost by the annual rental rate to determine how many years it would take for the cost of the rented furniture to exceed the cost of the purchased furniture: $39,000 / $19,800 = 1.97 years. In a little less than two years, the cost of the rental furniture will exceed the cost of the purchased furniture. If the small-business owner has the money, it would be worthwhile for them to buy rather than rent the office furniture.

Business analysis is the process of investigating and evaluating a business issue, problem, process, or approach. Businesses analyze financial data to evaluate the financial well-being of their operations at any given time. By comparing the same type of financial information from different consecutive time periods, a business can detect trends. By detecting trends, the business can determine if it needs to make changes. For example, if the business notices a substantial increase in sales-dollar volume over a three-month period, trends indicate an increase in spending. The business may decide to conduct further analysis to determine what customers are purchasing, and decide if it needs to increase the production or inventory levels of certain products.

The only source for any money that is generated through participation in a supply chain must come from the ultimate sale of the end product. Without this sale, no supply chain member will be able to receive revenues. Raw materials used in manufacturing play into the expenses side of the supply chain, but there are more expenses than just the raw materials.

Reviews should be conducted by management who interact with the employee most, which isn't always senior management. Reviews should be scheduled, and employees should be given advance notice.

An important part of monitoring quality is soliciting input from the workers who are actually performing the tasks, because they often have ideas that will help them do their jobs with more efficiency.

To calculate the percentage of gross profit, first subtract the cost of goods sold from annual sales to determine gross profit ($500,000 - $400,000 = $100,000).

Successful businesses understand that it is often easier and more cost effective to develop strategies that appeal to a portion of the market rather than the whole market. This is because consumers are unique and have different needs and wants. For example, some consumers want highquality goods and services, while others are less concerned with quality and want low prices. By dividing the market into segments, a business can determine which segments are more likely to buy its products. Then, the business can develop a plan of action to target the market that has similar needs and wants. The business's goal is to develop a loyal customer following and create brand insistence by appealing to the market that is most likely to purchase its products.

Customer profiling is the process of identifying a business's most likely or ideal customer through the use of demographic, psychographic, attitudinal, and behavioral information. If a business implements an effective customer profiling system, it leads to better customer service. By documenting customers' characteristics, a company will be able to predict issues before they come up, offer useful self-help resources, and better align with customer needs if they reach out to the business's service team. Instead of increasing the price of a campaign, it will lower it. The more specific the customer, the less money a business will spend. Rather than making the customer base broader, customer profiling focuses on identifying the specific buyers that'll actually buy a product, which is more valuable than targeting everyone.

Other impacts on business operations include less confusion, less duplication, and improved efficiencies, among others. Higher profits and lower costs are impacts an efficient supply chain has on a business's profitability.

Companies allowing employees to use their own devices may be common, but it provides a security risk. Providing employees with company devices will allow the company to ensure the machines have the necessary security measures; it also instills more responsibility on the employees.

Also, leased equipment can be returned at the end of the lease agreement and replaced with new equipment, which often saves the business repair expenses. Sometimes, businesses need specialized equipment for a certain project, and it is more economical to lease it for a short time than to buy equipment that will not be needed again.
