Traditionally, disintermediation has involved the elimination of intermediaries or middlemen like Kathy. This results in the transfer of products directly from producers (in this case, airlines) to the ultimate consumer. More broadly, though, disintermediation can include the displacement of traditional intermediaries with new, radically different types of intermediaries such as online travel agencies. The online travel agencies are successful because they can bring more value to consumers than many traditional brick-and-mortar travel agencies. A discrepancy of assortment is a difference between the product lines that a firm offers and the assortment of products that the consumer wants. Bulk-breaking involves dividing large quantities of products into smaller quantities as products move from the producer to middlemen to consumers. There is no indication that bulk-breaking is occurring. Exclusive distribution involves selling products through only one intermediary in a certain geographic area. Since more than one firm is selling airline tickets in the geographic area, exclusive distribution is not taking place. SOURCE: CM:006 SOURCE: Kotler, P., Bowen, J.T., & Makens, J.C. (2010).

Although privacy policies vary by business, they might include limiting the access that employees have to customer information and refusing to sell customer lists to third parties.

In an effort to help authorities apprehend the robber(s), witnesses should be asked to remain until the police arrive. If witnesses are on hand, police will be able to ask questions and obtain descriptions that will be helpful in the investigation. The victim(s) of the robbery should be taken to a quiet area instead of being left to talk with other witnesses. This will help prevent their memory from being confused or distorted. Any customers should remain on hand until released by the police. The doors need to be secured so that only the police or witnesses can enter the business. This is to protect the evidence.

Positioning is a product mix strategy in which a business creates a certain image or impression of a product in the minds of consumers.

Promotion is a critical consideration when introducing a new product because this function lets channel members and customers know that the good or service is available. The promotional efforts should be carefully planned and coordinated with the product's release. For example, a manufacturer might provide catalogs, brochures, coop-advertising funds, and product training to its intermediaries (e.g., dealers, wholesalers) before the product is released so that the intermediaries can explain the products to their customers or end users. Some channel members (e.g., retailers) might need to coordinate promotion so that newspaper and television advertising or special events are appropriately timed with the product's arrival on the stores' shelves. If the communication between a manufacturer and its intermediaries is already very good, the manufacturer needs to continue using good communication rather than improve it. Applying for a line of credit is a financial consideration. Ethics policies must not only be established, but they must communicated to the appropriate people or organizations.

Although collaboration and cooperation among individuals can be used to achieve a common goal, groupthink conditions can be detrimental to ethical decision making. Groupthink is an extreme form of cohesiveness in which all members of the group strive for unanimity (harmony) at any cost. This condition stifles independent thinking and objectivity. Group members who question another member's idea or action may be censored or cut off by the group majority. In addition, individuals begin to self-censor, which means they quiet their own conflicting thoughts for the \"good of the group.\" Groupthink can erode personal ethics and lead group members to do things they normally wouldn't do. In today's competitive business environment, the pressure to earn high profits has often resulted in fraudulent behavior, embezzlement, money laundering, etc. Such actions are often a result of groupthink conditions.

Also, tourists may not be aware of high-crime districts and accidentally walk into those areas. All of these factors set up tourists as targets of crime. As a result, the travel and tourism industry stresses security and tries to prepare tourists for possible problems. For example, tour operators may point out areas of cities that the group should avoid, or cruise ships might tell passengers to use only certain taxis in ports of call. Tourists are not looking for trouble, nor are they any more prone to injury than other people. Many tourists travel only with family members rather than as part of a group.

To process the coupons, the restaurant subtracts the discount amount from the cost of the two dinners.

The business monitors and tracks the invoices to make sure it is billed correctly. If the business finds a discrepancy (e.g., incorrect tax amount) on a bill, the business will likely contact the vendor to make necessary adjustments.

More broadly, though, disintermediation can include the displacement of traditional intermediaries with new, radically different types of intermediaries such as online travel agencies. The online travel agencies are successful because they can bring more value to consumers than many traditional brick-and-mortar travel agencies. A discrepancy of assortment is a difference between the product lines that a firm offers and the assortment of products that the consumer wants. Bulk-breaking involves dividing large quantities of products into smaller quantities as products move from the producer to middlemen to consumers.

The purpose of writing persuasive messages is to convince customers to do something, such as buy a product. To encourage them to take the correct action, it is important to appeal to their needs and show them why it is a benefit to do what you want them to do. For example, if you want customers to buy a new product, explain how that product will benefit them, such as by saving money or speeding up production. Customers are more likely to respond favorably when they understand how their needs will be satisfied. It is not effective to use aggressive words or demand a customer's attention as these techniques often offend customers.

Only a small number of dissatisfied customers actually take the time to complain to a business. Instead, they typically tell everyone they know about their bad experience, which can mean a lot of negative publicity for a company that didn't even get a chance to correct the problem. When a customer complains, s/he gives a business the opportunity to fix its mistakes. If a company handles the situation right, it can create a loyal customer. A company should never attempt to tell a customer s/he is wrong, even if s/he is. Instead, the person handling the complaint should listen and empathize with the customer. Fewer customer complaints may save a company time and frustration in the short term, but in the long term they can end up costing money. When customers complain about products or services, they alert a company to possible problems. A company can then fix those problems early on and avoid expensive fixes down the road. If a customer doesn't complain, it doesn't necessarily mean that s/he is satisfied. S/He may just not tell the business that s/he is unsatisfied, which, as mentioned earlier, can actually be much worse than a complaint. SOURCE: CR:010 SOURCE: Customer Expressions. (1999-2015).

A check is a negotiable instrument or bank draft made payable to a specific party for a specific amount of money.

Both individuals and businesses use checks to pay for goods and services such as rent, utilities, food, and supplies. When writing a check, an individual or business keeps a check register that records information about the transaction. This information includes the date the check is written, to whom the check is made payable, the amount of the check, and the check number. The register is a central location to record and track all of the checks written and the amount of money spent.

Therefore, tourists should use tour companies that are approved or recommended by the cruise line. This recommendation also applies to any transportation service (e.g., bus or taxi).

Price gouging is a pricing practice that involves raising prices above market value when demand is high, and no alternative is available to consumers. A business that temporarily increases prices for goods (e.g., lumber, milk, medicine) during a crisis is behaving in an unethical and, in many jurisdictions, an illegal manner. When a business engages in price gouging activities, it runs the risk of losing credibility with the public, which can result in a poor image or damaged reputation.

The price of the bundled products is usually lower than the combined price of the products sold separately. The lower price provides the travel client with an incentive to buy. The odd pricing strategy involves setting selling prices below even-dollar amounts to suggest a bargain. Prestige pricing involves deliberately putting an artificially high price on a good or service to suggest high quality and status.

Hospitality and tourism businesses use a variety of metrics to measure the performance of their promotions. Coupons are a form of sales promotion. A riverboat tour company can evaluate the effectiveness of its coupon sales promotion by calculating the number of redeemed coupons from a specific publication in relation to the publication's reach, which is the coupon-redemption rate, expressed as a percentage. If the redemption rate is low in relation to the ad-placement costs, the business may decide that it isn't worthwhile to advertise or place coupons in the publication in the future. A rebate is a return of part of the price a customer pays for a good or service, which is usually offered by the product's manufacturer.

There are several ways to obtain work experience without having a paying job. One way is to participate in school-operated programs, such as the school store or library.

Continuing education programs can help people keep up with trends associated with their industry. The availability of government funding is dependent on each government's resources and guidelines.

An increase in the number of guests and an increase in the number of rooms available"], "answer": "C", "reasoning": "A decrease in the number of guests and an increase in the number of rooms available. A decrease in the number of guests occurs during economic slowdowns because people are reluctant to spend their discretionary income on travel. Consequently, there is an increase in the number of rooms available as more rooms become available for rent. An increase in the number of guests and an increase in the number of rooms available does not follow the law of supply and demand, which suggests that as demand for rooms go up, supply typically goes down. A decrease in the number of guests and a decrease in the number of rooms available would work the other way because as demand goes down, the supply of rooms available for rent typically goes up. An increase in the number of guests and a decrease in the number of rooms available typically occurs during good economic times when people are more willing to spend their discretionary income on travel.

This strategy is used to gain quick recognition from travelers and to acquire an immediate slice of the market share. Psychological pricing refers to a minimally adjusted price that gives the customer a feeling of increased value and/or savings (e.g., $69.95 instead of $70.00). Price lining is the practice of selling goods/services at a limited number of predetermined price points, or levels. A price that is initially set deliberately on the high side is called price skimming. This concept is used to attract the customer who is willing to pay the higher price in order to be one of the first to use the good/service.
