Businesses usually are prevented from entering into legally binding contracts with certain groups of people because these people are not considered to have the capacity to understand the consequences of their actions.

It involves creating positive change through hard work over the long term. For example, Martin Luther King, Jr. had a vision in which his children would have equal rights with all Americans. His vision was to end racism, and he took many steps to make his vision come true. Due to his efforts, peoples' attitudes changed and laws were established to protect and ensure all peoples' rights, which created permanent results from his vision. When working toward a personal vision, a person may experience setbacks and challenges, such as limited resources.

Risk management is a business activity that involves the planning, controlling, preventing, and procedures to limit business losses. An important aspect of risk management involves complying with laws. If a business does not comply with laws, then it may face a lawsuit. If the business loses the lawsuit, it may be required to pay money to the plaintiff. For example, if an employee is severely injured on the job, s/he might decide to file a lawsuit against the business for negligent behavior. If the court finds that the business acted negligently because it didn't follow safety regulations, then the business may be required to pay the employee, which is costly to the business. Acquiring insurance that offers lower premiums saves the business money and is not always related to business regulations. Customer-satisfaction levels are not always related to the business's compliance issues.

Most businesses have specific policies that provide guidelines for the ways in which employees are expected to carry out their tasks. Following these guidelines can save the business money.

Organizations (i.e., corporations, industry/professional/trade associations) often form their own insurance companies, which are known as captive insurance companies. The founding organizations control their captive insurance companies' underwriting processes, premium rates, and claims-processing policies. This is an advantage to the founding companies because a primary reason they form their own insurance companies is they often carry risks that commercial insurance companies do not cover. For example, mining companies tend to carry more risk due to the dangerous nature of the mining process.

Risk management is a business activity that involves the planning, controlling, preventing, and procedures to limit business losses. An important aspect of risk management involves complying with laws. If a business does not comply with laws, then it may face a lawsuit. If the business loses the lawsuit, it may be required to pay money to the plaintiff. For example, if an employee is severely injured on the job, s/he might decide to file a lawsuit against the business for negligent behavior. If the court finds that the business acted negligently because it didn't follow safety regulations, then the business may be required to pay the employee, which is costly to the business.

When would-be burglars see surveillance cameras in several locations around a business, they are less likely to attempt to break in because they will be videotaped or photographed by the cameras. When the burglars' actions are taped, law enforcement agencies are more likely to identify and arrest them. Although surveillance cameras don't prevent all burglaries or robberies, they can often deter these activities. Most businesses use a combination of security measures to secure their facilities, including door and window locks and different types of alarm systems. Businesses need and use different types of alarm systems, such as fire alarms or smoke detectors, which are often required by law. Therefore, the use of surveillance cameras does not eliminate the need for alarm systems. Extortion is blackmail and would not necessarily be impacted by surveillance cameras.

When the money supply is loose, there is more money in circulation, which means there is more money available to loan.

Many businesses control expenses by hiring part-time employees at an hourly rate instead of salaried, full-time employees. The advantage to the business is the same number of employees working during a given time period but for less wages. To calculate the savings, first determine the weekly payroll expense for one part-time employee by multiplying the number of hours worked each week by the hourly rate ($11.50 x 20 =$230). Then, multiply that amount by the four part-time employees ($230 x 4 = $920); and the total weekly amount by the two-week pay period ($920 x 2 = $1,840). Next, determine what the payroll would be for two full-time employees by multiplying the weekly salary by the number of employees and that amount by the two-week pay period ($575 x 2 = $1,150; $1,150 x 2 = $2,300).
