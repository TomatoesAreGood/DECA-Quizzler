Because there are different ways that people process information, it is important to consider those differences when providing employees with verbal directions. For example, audio learners are more comfortable with sound and dialog, so when giving directions, it is beneficial to speak clearly and use terminology that the listeners can relate to. Sometimes this involves using a metaphor or simile to make a point. Diagrams and pictures are often useful when providing directions to visual learners. For learners who are motion-oriented, demonstrating the activity often reinforces the verbal explanation and makes it easier for employees to understand. This might include an actual demonstration or a video of a demonstration.

Identity theft occurs when an individual obtains and uses another person's information (e.g., credit cards) without that person's consent. To reduce the risk of identity theft, people should use secure web browsers to make purchases. Because Internet sales transactions often require a person to provide credit card information, it is important to make sure that the web browsers are secure. Using secure websites reduces the risk of computer hackers obtaining confidential information for fraudulent purposes. Another way to reduce the risk of identity theft is to memorize passwords. If a personal planner is stolen, the risk of identity theft goes because the passwords are written down. Also, people should not share bank account numbers with others. When more people know an individual's banking information, the risk of identity theft increases.

Long-range planning involves planning for the entire company and is a responsibility of top management, not the first-level supervisor.

Because there are different ways that people process information, it is important to consider those differences when providing employees with verbal directions. For example, audio learners are more comfortable with sound and dialog, so when giving directions, it is beneficial to speak clearly and use terminology that the listeners can relate to. Sometimes this involves using a metaphor or simile to make a point. Diagrams and pictures are often useful when providing directions to visual learners. For learners who are motion-oriented, demonstrating the activity often reinforces the verbal explanation and makes it easier for employees to understand. This might include an actual demonstration or a video of a demonstration.

Identity theft occurs when an individual obtains and uses another person's information (e.g., credit cards) without that person's consent. To reduce the risk of identity theft, people should use secure web browsers to make purchases. Because Internet sales transactions often require a person to provide credit-card information, it is important to make sure that the web browsers are secure. Using secure web sites reduces the risk of computer hackers obtaining confidential information for fraudulent purposes. Another way to reduce the risk of identity theft is to memorize passwords. If a personal planner is stolen, the risk of identity theft goes up because the passwords are written down. Also, people should not share bank account numbers with others.

Volunteer work refers to activities or tasks that a person performs without pay. Although responsibilities might be menial in nature, the experience provides the volunteer with insight as to how business operates and what is expected of employees. Volunteers usually do not receive monetary compensation, technical training, or guidance counseling. SOURCE: PD:032 SOURCE: Kimbrell, G., & Vineyard, B.S. (2006).

The business must decide the type of information it needs before it can obtain and use that data. Businesses do not need to determine the type of computer system to purchase, the type of report that is required, or the type of collection process to develop before using relevant data.

Because the technical-trends report was written recently, the information is likely to be up-to-date. Due to technology, the world is constantly experiencing medical breakthroughs and changes; therefore, a journal article that was published a decade (10 years) ago is less likely to contain up-to-date information.

A letter is not likely to overcome the impression that a nervous applicant made during an interview, but it may modify it somewhat. Letters demonstrate written communication skills, not oral. Interviewers must remain objective in order to hire the most qualified candidate for the job, which makes it unlikely that a hiring decision would be based on a letter.

Active listening involves the use of nonverbal cues, paraphrasing, questioning, and other techniques to let a speaker know that a message has been heard and understood.

Taking steps to minimize barriers, such as closing a door, or letting a phone call go to voice mail can decrease distractions and improve active listening.

Going concern assumes that the business will go on forever (indefinitely). Business entity is the assumption that the owner(s) and the business are independent units. The third assumption is the accounting period, which indicates that each business is divided into specific increments of time for the purpose of reporting financial data (e.g., month, quarter, annual). Tangible existence and open reality are fictitious terms. SOURCE: FI:086 SOURCE: Guerrieri, D.J., Haber, F.B., Hoyt, W.B., & Turner, R.E. (2004).

Companies use various touch points to create these experiences for their customers. Touch points are all of the opportunities that a company has to connect with its customers and reinforce its brand value. Touch points may include the company's employees, product attributes and packaging, and technological systems (e.g., telephone, website). A slogan (tag line) is a phrase that is easy to remember, such as \"Nationwide is on your side.\" A trade character is a symbol that is personified (e.g., Tony the Tiger). Businesses often use slogans and trade characters as elements of their brands. Changing slogans frequently or developing different trade characters may confuse customers, which may reduce brand recognition.

If an individual has a lot of allowable expenses that are deductible, the individual often can reduce the amount of tax that is owed. These deductions must total more than the standard deduction in order to save money on taxes.

Stereotyping tends to classify certain people in groups (e.g., gender, race, age) that possess certain characteristics.

Stereotyping tends to foster biased attitudes in the workplace and can lead to an \u201cus versus them\u201d attitude, which creates a negative, less productive work environment. To cultivate a positive work environment, employees must recognize their differences and embrace diversity. By embracing diversity, self-directed work teams tend to function more efficiently.

Credit is the arrangement by which individuals or businesses can purchase now and pay later. Many types of businesses (e.g., banks, large retailers) offer credit cards to consumers and businesses to purchase goods and services. Usually, the credit card issuer sends the credit card holder a monthly statement. The information on the statement includes a list of the purchases made during the billing cycle and the amount owed for the purchases, which includes the interest charges. If the credit card holder pays the minimum amount due, the amount of interest owed accumulates on the balance due until the debt is paid off. Because interest rates can be high, this can be a disadvantage to the credit card holder. It is important to establish a good credit rating in order to borrow money in the future from other lenders. Therefore, establishing a credit rating is not necessarily a disadvantage. Credit card holders do not earn quarterly dividends on their credit cards.

Therefore, Porter's decision to wait to take action negatively impacts both the customer and the company. Many routine problems can be resolved without involving supervisors. Porter's lapse of judgment in one situation does not mean that he does not have the ability to perform his job well. Customers react differently to problems and inconveniences; therefore, it cannot be assumed that most customers will become very angry over simple mistakes\u2014some of them may become slightly annoyed.

Unless they are properly trained, employees should not perform maintenance activities on machinery. If the machinery is not handled appropriately, employees could be seriously injured and the machinery could be damaged. If some of the employees' responsibilities are to operate the machinery, then the supervisors' jobs should ensure that employees operate the machinery properly, rather than operate it themselves.

Professional-looking resumes are uncluttered, concise, and error-free. A business that receives a resume with spelling and grammatical errors is likely to view the applicant as a person who is not concerned with detail and accuracy. Attention to detail and accuracy are usually qualities that businesses look for in job applicants. Therefore, before printing and submitting a resume, the writer should carefully read the document to identify spelling and grammatical errors. It is also a good idea for the writer to have other people look at the resume to ensure that they didn't overlook any errors. Experts recommend beginning your resume with your name, contact information, and professional goal(s). There is some debate about whether to include a photograph of yourself in your resume; however, most experts do not recommend including one. Using colorful text may be distracting to the reader.

One way that an individual employee can help protect company information on a daily basis is to log out of their computer when leaving work for lunch or for the evening. By doing so, it becomes much more difficult for an intruder to access company information on that particular computer. However, if the employee also stores their log-in information (i.e., username and password) in a desk drawer at work, that very same intruder can easily access company data if they have time and opportunity to look in the drawers of the desk.

The internet benefits businesses because it allows them to promote their products on their websites.

Sometimes this involves using a metaphor or simile to make a point. Diagrams and pictures are often useful when providing directions to visual learners. For learners who are motion-oriented, demonstrating the activity often reinforces the verbal explanation and makes it easier for employees to understand.

Therefore, a business should take steps to ensure that its employees understand how their actions affect the business's image. Businesses often develop policies to ensure that employees are engaging in behaviors that support the company's image. Because WNJ wants to project an image of being responsive to its customers' needs, it developed a policy that employees must respond to inquiries within 24 hours. This may include a quick phone call just to tell the customer that the business is working on a problem or issue. Requiring signed timecards is a personnel policy rather than a way to reinforce the business's public image.

Customer relationship management (CRM) is the combination of strategies, processes, and policies that a business uses to meet or exceed customer expectations and to provide customers with outstanding experiences at every touch point. An important aspect of CRM is ensuring that customer data are current. For example, if the customer notifies the business about a change of address and the business does not update its computer database to reflect the change, the business's promotional mailings and invoices will not reach the customer in a timely manner, if at all. In another situation, a business might have multiple database records for one customer. If the business sends multiple (excessive) copies of promotional materials (e.g., product catalog) to the customer based on the data in the database, the customer may become annoyed. Sending multiple copies of a single mailing to one customer is also a waste of the business's money.

The matrix organizational structure involves integrated departmental functions with product or project orientation. For example, a technology specialist, a marketing researcher, a financial advisor, and a manufacturing line supervisor are members of different departments but often work together to develop a product or improve a process. The advantage to businesses of using this organizational structure is that the business is applying its resources efficiently because a representative from each of the major departments provides a unique set of skills and knowledge to achieve the business's goals. Often, workers have two or more supervisors in the matrix organizational design. The matrix organizational design may improve the business's overall efficiency, but it does not always improve an individual's productivity. Departmental organizational design segments employees by their areas of expertise (e.g., accounting, sales, and production).

For safety purposes, most localities require that businesses have fire extinguishers placed throughout their facilities. Business facilities that have kitchens should keep fire extinguishers in a prominent space of the kitchen so that they are easily available to put out small fires that are contained in pans, microwaves, etc. In the situation presented, the fire is small and contained to a limited location, so Ken should be able to use the fire extinguisher to put it out. If Ken leaves to tell his supervisor about the fire, the fire may spread. Ken should leave the kitchen and follow the company's fire evacuation policies if the fire is spreading. The company's policies may involve leaving the kitchen and to advise others to evacuate, opening a window, or calling 911 (rather than 411) to request assistance from the fire department after everyone has evacuated the building.

Prevents armed robberies"], "answer": "B", "reasoning": "Discourages attempted burglaries. When would-be burglars see surveillance cameras in several locations around a business, they are less likely to attempt to break in because they will be video-taped or photographed by the cameras. When the burglars' actions are taped, law enforcement agencies are more likely to identify and arrest them. Although surveillance cameras don't prevent all burglaries or robberies, they can often deter these activities. Most businesses use a combination of security measures to secure their facilities, including door and window locks and different types of alarm systems. Businesses need and use different types of alarm systems, such as fire alarms or smoke detectors, which are often required by law. Therefore, the use of surveillance cameras does not eliminate the need for alarm systems. Extortion is blackmail and would not necessarily be impacted by surveillance cameras.

If a business runs out of necessary supplies, the employees' productivity decreases because they do not have the tools available to do their jobs efficiently. For example, if a business runs out of copy paper and forms, its employees cannot print letters, reports, or invoices, or conduct other activities that are necessary to keep the business operating smoothly. Many businesses develop inventory control procedures to monitor their supplies to reduce the risk of running out of supplies.

The supervisor makes this assumption because the employee has completed tasks by the given deadlines in the past. The supervisor's assumption is based on his/her experience. However, the employee experienced a computer problem, which prevented her/him from completing the task by deadline. So, in this particular situation, the supervisor's assumption was incorrect.

The grapevine is an informal method of communication. It often provides accurate, positive information, but it can also communicate negative, distorted, or incorrect information or rumors. For example, employees who hear and spread rumors about layoffs or salary cuts may not have sent or received accurate or complete information. If management does not address the rumors, they can cause friction and anxiety in the workplace. To combat rumors, management can take steps by communicating regularly with its employees through e-mail, newsletters, memos, and meetings. By addressing rumors and responding honestly before the rumors get out of hand, employees are more likely to trust and respect management, and listen less to the negative communication that travels through the grapevine. In some situations, managers may not legally be able to talk about issues, but it is important that they acknowledge the situation and explain why they cannot comment. Successful businesses depend on employees who collaborate, so limiting their contact is a detrimental and unrealistic option. The purpose of conducting employee performance reviews is to evaluate an employee's work. Conducting performance reviews will not eliminate grapevine communication. Developing ethics policies is important; however, unless the policies are communicated to employees, the policies are pointless. SOURCE: EI:038 SOURCE: DuBrin, A. (2009).

A rolling (continuous) budget replaces each passing month with a new month added to the end of the budget, so there is always a year-long budget in place. Because a new month is added to the budget on a regular basis, managers need to assess and adjust figures on a monthly basis to reflect the various factors that influence business activities. By being able to change and adapt, the rolling budget provides the business with flexibility. The zero-based budgeting method requires managers to demonstrate the need for every expense. Although unexpected expenses do come up and should be a consideration when establishing any type of budget, a rolling budget does not provide managers with an advantage over other budgeting methods in terms of forecasting unexpected expenses.

A very important aspect of orientation is to communicate the employer's philosophy and behavioral expectations so the employee can adapt accordingly.

An executive summary is a summary of the most important points of a longer document such as a business report, business plan, or marketing plan. In fact, the executive summary is typically considered to be the most important part of a company's business or marketing plan because it gives an overview of the entire document and helps the reader to determine whether it is worthwhile to read any further in the document. The main ideas of the executive summary should be presented in the same order that they appear in the full report.

Budget accounts are often used by furniture or appliance retailers as a form of short-term credit \u2014for example, \"90 days same as cash\" means that customers can purchase goods on credit with the same advantages they would have with cash purchases. Budget accounts do not charge interest if the user makes payments on time. However, if a customer doesn't pay the amount in full by the end of the 90 days, s/he is subject to finance charges applying to the full time period. In revolving credit accounts, the maximum amount of money that the credit user can owe (also known as the credit limit) is set at the time the credit account is opened. Regular credit accounts are also known as open credit accounts because they allow credit users to buy at any time during a set period. At the end of that time, the person or business is expected to pay the entire amount that is due for the purchases made during that period. An installment credit account is designed to handle one credit transaction, which is paid in installments within a certain time period. The credit user makes a down payment and signs an agreement to pay monthly installments until the total is paid.

Mitigation involves reducing or controlling the impact of a risk if it occurs. In the question stem, the business takes steps to reduce the risk of broken windows due to an approaching hurricane by protecting the windows with plywood. If the hurricane winds hit the business facility the plywood will break the impact of the wind, lowering the risk of window damage. Risk acceptance or retention involves accepting the consequences of the risk because the potential payoff is higher than the losses. Avoidance is a risk-response strategy that involves choosing not to do something because the risk of loss is high.

Because there are different ways that people process information, it is important to consider those differences when providing employees with verbal directions. For example, audio learners are more comfortable with sound and dialog, so when giving directions, it is beneficial to speak clearly and use terminology that the listeners can relate to. Sometimes this involves using a metaphor or simile to make a point. Diagrams and pictures are often useful when providing directions to visual learners. For learners who are motion-oriented, demonstrating the activity often reinforces the verbal explanation and makes it easier for employees to understand. This might include an actual demonstration or a video of a demonstration.

Identity theft occurs when an individual obtains and uses another person's information (e.g., credit cards) without that person's consent. To reduce the risk of identity theft, people should use secure web browsers to make purchases. Because Internet sales transactions often require a person to provide credit card information, it is important to make sure that the web browsers are secure. Using secure websites reduces the risk of computer hackers obtaining confidential information for fraudulent purposes. Another way to reduce the risk of identity theft is to memorize passwords. If a personal planner is stolen, the risk of identity theft goes because the passwords are written down. Also, people should not share bank account numbers with others. When more people know an individual's banking information, the risk of identity theft increases.

Similarly, negotiating contract terms ethically does not often lead to the cheapest possible contract. Ethically negotiating with vendors often means finding a balance that benefits both sides. Increasing contract terms is also not a direct result of ethical behavior. It is only ethical to ask for more funding if the project itself requires the additional funds.

Association refers to the method of identifying relationships between different variables or data items in large databases, and it is useful when trying to forecast. Clustering is the process of discovering groups (or clusters) of data and categorizing data that are identical in some way into the same class. Clustering is similar to classification, but clustering identifies similarities between data and groups them according to those common characteristics, which differentiates them from other clusters.

Because Rebecca went on with her day and came up with a solution thanks to a flash of insight, she used the intuitive method of problem-solving. Brainstorming is a problemsolving method in which a group throws out possible solutions to the problem during a specific period of time. Mind mapping is a problem-solving method that organizes ideas and information graphically, using shapes, pictures, and words. It typically involves drawing out your problem on a large sheet of paper or a board. The seven-step method requires problem solvers to follow a specific process for solving problems.

Take on several challenging projects at once", "B. Be sure to focus on tasks, not on goals", "C. Avoid breaking large projects into smaller parts", "D. Determine which tasks are important and urgent"], "answer": "D", "reasoning": "Determine which tasks are important and urgent. Time management is the process of controlling events to accomplish priorities. There are several general principles of time management, including that you should determine which tasks are important and urgent. Not every task is the same. Some can be categorized as important, which means they are essential for achieving your goals, while urgent tasks are those that demand immediate attention. Identifying which tasks are important and which are urgent can help you better manage your time throughout the workday. Another general principle of time management is to focus on goals, not on tasks, which can help keep you focused on the bigger picture. Dividing large projects into smaller parts is another principle, as smaller deadlines for yourself along the way can help you stay on task. Instead of taking on several challenging projects at once, you should follow the principle of not biting off more than you can chew. Taking on too many challenging projects at once can leave you stressed or overwhelmed and can spread you too thin, which will prevent you from giving your best effort and can lead you to rush tasks.
