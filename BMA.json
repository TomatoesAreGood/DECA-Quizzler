The purpose of writing persuasive messages is to convince customers to do something such as buy a product or pay an overdue bill. To encourage them to take the correct action, it is important to appeal to their needs and show them why it is a benefit to do what you want them to do. For example, if you want customers to buy a new product, explain how that product will benefit them, such as by saving money or speeding up production. Customers are more likely to respond favorably when they understand how their needs will be satisfied, and they will benefit from taking action. Customers usually are not interested in the business's point of view or predictions for the future unless those predictions will benefit them. Persuasive messages are more effective if they explain how customers will benefit rather than explaining the technical aspects in detail.

Governments develop and enforce various regulations to protect the well-being of society. If a business is not following safety regulations, it is not protecting the well-being of its employees and customers. An employee should report the noncompliance so the government can step in and ensure that the business takes corrective action before an accident occurs and someone is injured. By reporting noncompliance of safety regulations, the employee may prevent a tragedy from occurring and prevent the business from receiving poor publicity and a bad reputation that would likely result from an accident or injury. Although it depends on the type of product, it is often legal for a business to sell substitute goods to consumers.

They often provide information about the progress of current projects or an explanation of upcoming events. Not all businesses have boards of directors or planning committees. However, these are examples of internal audiences that may, or may not, receive memorandums. A group of suppliers is an external audience. SOURCE: CO:094 SOURCE: Hodges, L. (n.d.). Memos.

An analytical report is a document that explains and evaluates an issue, opportunity, or problem. Often, the analytical report includes recommendations for a business to take a certain course of action. If the writer anticipates that most members of the audience are receptive and will agree with the recommendations, then using a direct approach to structure the report is optimal. The direct approach involves writing the report so it focuses the attention on the conclusions and recommendations. If the writer anticipates a skeptical, argumentative, or indecisive audience, the indirect approach may be the best way to structure the report. The indirect approach involves preparing a logical argument that supports the recommendations and focuses on the rationale behind the recommendations. Intellect refers to a person's level of understanding about a topic or concept, which varies per person and is not necessarily related to the structure of the report.

Stress is a mental, physical, or emotional feeling of pressure or tension. Ongoing stress can have a negative effect on an individual's productivity. People who procrastinate tend to place additional stress on themselves and others because they do not provide enough time to complete the work to the best of their abilities. As a result, work efforts are rushed, mistakes are made, conflicts occur, and the work quality is compromised. One way to reduce this source of stress to is plan your work well in advance. By doing so, you can leave enough time to address unexpected situations and complete quality work with fewer mistakes.

Although collaboration and cooperation among individuals can be used to achieve a common goal, groupthink conditions can be detrimental to ethical decision making. Groupthink is an extreme form of cohesiveness in which all members of the group strive for unanimity (harmony) at any cost. This condition stifles independent thinking and objectivity. Group members who question another member's idea or action may be censored or cut off by the group majority. In addition, individuals begin to self-censor, which means they quiet their own conflicting thoughts for the \"good of the group.\" Groupthink can erode personal ethics and lead group members to do things they normally wouldn't do.

When employees don't have a clear understanding of the business's expectations, they put the business at risk. Businesses cannot assume that employees know their expectations. Employees who do not follow the business's ethics guidelines may cross a legal line without knowing they have done so. If employees cross ethical lines and break the law, the business may experience fines and obtain unfavorable publicity.

When developing an analytical report that addresses a controversial issue or contains information that readers might disagree with, the writer should provide logical arguments that explain and support their conclusions. By providing logical arguments, the writer is more likely to persuade readers to accept the conclusions. Technical statistics may distract the reader. Personal opinions should not be expressed during an analytical report. Enthusiastic statements that do not provide logical arguments or supporting evidence are less likely to convince readers that the conclusions are reasonable.

If you cannot pay off your balance each month, work to pay off high-interest credit cards first, since high-interest credit cards cost you more in the long run than low-interest cards. Choose credit cards with low limits so that you have less of an opportunity to accumulate debt. Credit-card cash advances usually result in extremely high interest charges, often 20% or more. So, it is wise to avoid cash advances, rather than using them to pay debt. SOURCE: FI:071 SOURCE: Basco, P. (2006-2012). Seven ways to avoid runaway credit card debt.

An effective negotiator wants to give up (concede) something minor or unimportant early to make it seem more valuable than it really is.

A whistle-blower is an employee who informs on a company that is doing something wrong or harmful. In most cases, the employee tells an agency that has the authority to make the company change its ways. An example is an employee reporting a safety hazard to an agency that can make the company correct the problem, pay a fine, or both. If businesses take disciplinary action against a whistle-blower, they are being unethical because the employee has the right to report wrongdoing. Unethical discipline might include giving the employee bad performance ratings that are not appropriate or denying promotions that have been earned. Ethical businesses try to treat all employees equally and not punish those who point out problems. Downsizing the workforce is ethical if handled correctly and often occurs when the economy is slow.

Price fixing is an illegal business agreement in which competing businesses agree on prices of their products, resulting in little choice for the consumer. Pricing fixing also keeps smaller businesses from being able to compete with those businesses that engage in the illegal activity. Therefore, the antitrust laws not only protect consumers, they also protect other businesses from being unfairly pushed out of the market. Monopoly refers to a condition in which one supplier controls a market and there are no substitute goods or services readily available. Antitrust laws are in place to protect consumers and businesses from monopolistic activities; however, the term equitable monopoly is not one that is widely recognized in the business law field.

This has a negative effect on the economy because the higher inflation rate means higher prices for goods and services. Although the employees received a raise, the raise was not equal to the rate of inflation, so employees actually lost purchasing power. They have more money to spend, but the goods and services they want cost more than their pay increase.

When an employee invents a product as a part of his/her job duties, ownership rights generally belong to the employer. To further protect the business's legal ownership of the invention, it is best for employers to have employees sign an invention assignment agreement at the time of hire. This agreement is a document that transfers invention ownership from the inventor (employee) to the employer. The government issues patents rather than a trade association.

When selecting a financial-services provider, it is important to make sure that the provider is qualified. One way to do this is to verify the provider's credentials.

An important part of monitoring quality is soliciting input from the workers who are actually performing the tasks, because they often have ideas that will help them do their jobs with more efficiency.

There are many ways that businesses can control their operating expenses. One of these is to lease equipment rather than buy it.

Also, leased equipment can be returned at the end of the lease agreement and replaced with new equipment, which often saves the business repair expense. Sometimes, businesses need specialized equipment for a certain project, and it is more economical to lease it for a short time than to buy equipment that will not be needed again.

Markup pricing ", "B. One-price policies ", "C. Price skimming ", "D. Below-cost pricing"], "answer": "D", "reasoning": "Below-cost pricing. When a company prices its products below cost, it makes it difficult for other companies to compete with the low prices, which they cannot afford to charge, and might eventually force them out of business. To prevent this situation from happening, many governments have laws that make it illegal for businesses to use below-cost pricing. When a business charges one price for all items it sells, it is using a one-price policy. Price skimming is a pricing strategy that involves setting prices higher than those of the competition. Markup is the difference between the cost of a product and its selling price. SOURCE: PI:017 SOURCE: Farese, L.S., Kimbrell, G., & Woloszyk, C.A. (2006).

An ethical manager does not discuss an employee's confidential information (e.g., performance evaluations, health issues, personal problems, salary) with other employees. Ethical managers treat employees with respect and do not share private information. Discussing an employee's personal matters with others usually leads to distrust and morale problems among the company's employees. Managers who share this type of information are not using sound judgment. Sharing one employee's confidential information with others is not an example of impartial feedback or office communication.
