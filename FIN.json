Product development is the process of creating new goods and services. Brainstorming is a creative-thinking technique. Market segmentation is dividing a large market into small markets.

To reduce the risk of unauthorized access to confidential information, businesses often assign computer passwords to allow authorized employees to view secured information. This reduces the risk of confidential information getting into the wrong hands. Encryption, rather than decryption, is a way to protect information. Encryption is the process of transforming information into a secret code so that unauthorized users are not able to read it. Groupware applications are software programs that allow several computer users to access the same information from different locations. Spooling is the process of transferring computer data to a temporary location so the data can be retrieved and processed through a different computer program.

Risk management is a business activity that involves the planning, controlling, preventing, and procedures to limit business losses. An important aspect of risk management involves complying with laws. If a business does not comply with laws, then it may face a lawsuit. If the business loses the lawsuit, it may be required to pay money to the plaintiff. For example, if an employee is severely injured on the job, s/he might decide to file a lawsuit against the business for negligent behavior. If the court finds that the business acted negligently because it didn't follow safety regulations, then the business may be required to pay the employee, which is costly to the business. Acquiring insurance that offers lower premiums saves the business money and is not always related to business regulations.

Three common types of financial statement analysis are vertical analysis, horizontal analysis, and ratio analysis. When conducting vertical analysis, an individual calculates each individual item on a financial statement as a percentage of the total. After doing so, the analyst can develop common-size financial statements that allow him/her to compare performance across several years for a single company or across several different companies. Horizontal analysis, which is sometimes known as trend analysis, involves analyzing dollar amounts on financial statements for a single company across several years. Horizontal analysis does not involve the development of common-size financial statements. Ratio analysis involves the calculation of ratios based on a company's financial data. It allows analysts to compare numbers within a financial statement and determine the relationships among numbers on different financial statements. It can also be used to compare the performance of multiple companies. SOURCE: FI:334 SOURCE: eNotes.com. (n.d.). Financial statement analysis.

To determine how much you should invest today, calculate the present value of your investment using the formula Present Value = Future Value / (1 + Interest Rate)Number of Years. So, the present value of your investment is equal to $8,000 / (1 + 0.04)3 . To solve this equation, first add one to the interest rate (1 + 0.04 = 1.04). Next, raise this sum to the third power, which is the same as multiplying the sum by itself three times (1.043 = 1.04 X 1.04 X 1.04 = 1.1249). Finally, divide the future value of your investment by this product ($8,000 / 1.1249 = $7,111.75). To have $8,000 in three years, you need to invest $7,111.75 today.

Internal records provide businesses with information about their customers' buying habits and product usage. By reviewing inventory reports, a business can determine which products are selling well and which products are moving slowly. This information may prompt the business to phase out the slow moving product and increase promotional efforts for the products that are selling well. Customers' invoices provide information about an individual customer's buying preferences and habits. For example, invoices might reveal that certain customers buy a certain quantity of a particular product four times a month. By knowing this type of information, the business can customize promotions for its customers and take steps to ensure that it has sufficient product on hand when it is needed. Financial reports provide information about customers' credit status and limits. Customer invoices do not provide information about a product's level of quality.

By paying attention to what competitors are doing, businesses often are able to identify product opportunities. Once the opportunity is identified, businesses often evaluate a prototype and test the market. One of the final steps before introducing a new product is developing a brand.

Organizations (i.e., corporations, industry/professional/trade associations) often form their own insurance companies, which are known as captive insurance companies.

So, the present value of your investment is equal to $8,000 / (1 + 0.04)3. To solve this equation, first add one to the interest rate (1 + 0.04 = 1.04). Next, raise this sum to the third power, which is the same as multiplying the sum by itself three times (1.043 = 1.04 X 1.04 X 1.04 = 1.1249). Finally, divide the future value of your investment by this product ($8,000 / 1.1249 = $7,111.75). To have $8,000 in three years, you need to invest $7,111.75 today.

Employees who are hired under the impression that they will only work 20 hours per week, for example, will certainly not appreciate it when they are told they actually need to work 30 or 40, especially if their compensation doesn't increase accordingly. If workers are consistently overburdened, they are unlikely to stay with the company for very long\u2014and will probably resent the company's management in the meantime.

Because a customer's decisions are based on many factors that a database cannot capture, it is difficult to determine that specific person's actions. Therefore, a database would not be an efficient tool to use to predict when the customer will place his/her next order, to learn why s/he moved a checking account to another bank, or to determine what product s/he will order next.

Risk management is a business activity that involves the planning, controlling, preventing, and procedures to limit business losses. An important aspect of risk management involves complying with laws. If a business does not comply with laws, then it may face a lawsuit. If the business loses the lawsuit, it may be required to pay money to the plaintiff. For example, if an employee is severely injured on the job, s/he might decide to file a lawsuit against the business for negligent behavior. If the court finds that the business acted negligently because it didn't follow safety regulations, then the business may be required to pay the employee, which is costly to the business.

Prevents armed robberies"], "answer": "C", "reasoning": "Discourages attempted burglaries. When would-be burglars see surveillance cameras in several locations around a business, they are less likely to attempt to break in because they will be videotaped or photographed by the cameras. When the burglars' actions are taped, law enforcement agencies are more likely to identify and arrest them. Although surveillance cameras don't prevent all burglaries or robberies, they can often deter these activities. Most businesses use a combination of security measures to secure their facilities, including door and window locks and different types of alarm systems. Businesses need and use different types of alarm systems, such as fire alarms or smoke detectors, which are often required by law. Therefore, the use of surveillance cameras does not eliminate the need for alarm systems. Extortion is blackmail and would not necessarily be impacted by surveillance cameras.

This is a good time for customers to borrow money because they can shop around for the best interest rates. A loose money supply encourages economic growth, which usually results in more investing. The growth is good for businesses and often leads to an increase in employment. SOURCE:\tEC:047 SOURCE:\tO'Sullivan, A., & Sheffrin, S.M. (2003). Economics: Principles in action (pp. 430-431).

If this occurs, the investment will provide a substantial return. In this example, stock that sell for $14 a share today is predicted to sell for three times that amount in two years. To determine the value of the shares at that time, multiply the current price by three ($14 x 3 = $42), and the future price by the number of shares ($42 x 100 = $4,200). If the prediction is true, the initial $1,400 investment will be worth $4,200 in two years which is a significant return.

Many businesses control expenses by hiring part-time employees at an hourly rate instead of salaried, full-time employees. The advantage to the business is the same number of employees working during a given time period but for less wages. To calculate the savings, first determine the weekly payroll expense for one part-time employee by multiplying the number of hours worked each week by the hourly rate ($11.50 x 20 =$230). Then, multiply that amount by the four part-time employees ($230 x 4 = $920); and the total weekly amount by the two-week pay period ($920 x 2 = $1,840). Next, determine what the payroll would be for two full-time employees by multiplying the weekly salary by the number of employees and that amount by the two-week pay period ($575 x 2 = $1,150; $1,150 x 2 = $2,300).
