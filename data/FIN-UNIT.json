Most financial-analysis software calculates the different financial ratios automatically and then evaluates those ratios to determine company strengths and weaknesses for the user. DuPont modeling helps the user examine the impact of each financial ratio on return on equity. Forecasting features are often used to make predictions, develop budgets, and experiment with \"what-if\" scenarios. SOURCE: FM:014 SOURCE: Jackson, A. (2014, June 13).

Businesses are constantly looking for ways to use their resources more efficiently. Two popular methods of achieving this goal are lean operations (manufacturing) and Six Sigma. The leanoperations method involves eliminating waste (the ineffective use of resources) to improve efficiency. According to the lean-operations philosophy, when efficiency increases, the business will have fewer errors, which leads to higher profits. Six Sigma is a quality-management framework that involves continuously setting higher goals of perfection. The Six Sigma framework builds upon previous goals to set higher goals, which continuously improves the quality of the business's goods, services, or processes. The ultimate goal is to maximize outputs, have no process or product defects, and minimize production costs. Therefore, an important aspect of the Six Sigma philosophy is to continuously lower costs while improving quality. Lean operations do not focus on reducing wages, automation, or standards.

However, data mining is not as effective when trying to pinpoint information about one particular customer. Because a customer's decisions are based on many factors that a database cannot capture, it is difficult to determine that specific person's actions. Therefore, a database would not be an efficient tool to use to predict when the customer will place his/her next order, to learn why s/he moved a checking account to another bank, or to determine what product s/he will order next. Probability models are more successful in predicting what a customer will do and why. SOURCE: FM:012 SOURCE: Alter, A. (2007, June 13). What data mining can and can't do.

Risk management is a business activity that involves the planning, controlling, preventing, and procedures to limit business losses. An important aspect of risk management involves complying with laws. If a business does not comply with laws, then it may face a lawsuit. If the business loses the lawsuit, it may be required to pay money to the plaintiff. For example, if an employee is severely injured on the job, s/he might decide to file a lawsuit against the business for negligent behavior. If the court finds that the business acted negligently because it didn't follow safety regulations, then the business may be required to pay the employee, which is costly to the business.

Therefore, it is to the business's advantage to use quality control methods so the work will be done correctly rather than spend money to correct mistakes, handle customer complaints, and find new customers. Using quality control methods involves time, but it is time well spent to reduce the cost of correcting mistakes. Using quality control methods usually decreases waste. Some quality control methods might require directions which could be a disadvantage. SOURCE: OP:164 SOURCE: Pride, W.M., Hughes, R.J., & Kapoor, J.R. (2008). Business (9th ed.) [p. 293].

SUGGING is an acronym for \"selling under the guise of research.\" SUGGING is an unethical practice in which a marketer pretends to conduct research but, in fact, is really attempting to sell a good or service to a consumer. SUGGING is deceptive and rarely facilitates a long-term selling relationship. It also harms the integrity of the general marketing-research field because potential respondents who have been subjected to SUGGING are less likely to trust researchers and are likely to question their true motives. A telemarketer who asks a person if s/he knows anyone who might buy a certain product is trying to obtain a referral. Sending samples to consumers is a promotional technique.

By reviewing inventory reports, a business can determine which products are selling well and which products are moving slowly.

Customers' invoices provide information about an individual customer's buying preferences and habits. For example, invoices might reveal that certain customers buy a certain quantity of a particular product four times a month. By knowing this type of information, the business can customize promotions for its customers and take steps to ensure that it has sufficient product on hand when it is needed.

Risk management involves the planning, controlling, preventing, and procedures used by management to limit business losses. Risk management is an important activity because it enables event planners to avoid liability, or the responsibility for injury or loss.

For example, when customers buy tickets to events, they often agree to the terms printed on the ticket that indicate that they are responsible for their own safety. Then, if they are injured, the event planners may not be legally responsible for damages.

To determine how much your investments will be worth in five years, calculate the future values of the investments. The formula used to find the future value of money is Future Value = Present Value X (1 + Interest Rate)Number of Years. So, the future value of your first investment is equal to $5,000 X (1 + 0.06)5 . To solve this equation, first add one to the interest rate (1+ 0.06 = 1.06). Next, raise this sum to the fifth power, which is the same as multiplying the sum by itself five times (1.065 = 1.06 X 1.06 X 1.06 X 1.06 X 1.06 = 1.3382). Finally, multiply this product by the original amount of the first investment to find its future value ($5,000 X 1.3382 = $6,691). Next, repeat the process for the second investment. Its future value is equal to $15,000 X (1 + 0.09)5 . First, add one to the interest rate (1+ 0.09 = 1.09). Then, raise this sum to the fifth power, which is the same as multiplying the sum by itself five times (1.095 = 1.09 X 1.09 X 1.09 X 1.09 X 1.09 = 1.5386). Next, multiply this product by the original amount of the second investment to find its future value ($15,000 X 1.5386 = $23,079).

Businesses review a customer's income, assets, debt ratio, credit history, etc., to determine if they are creditworthy. If the customer carries a high level of debt in relation to their assets, it would be too risky for the business to offer credit because the customer is more likely to become delinquent.

When would-be burglars see surveillance cameras in several locations around a business, they are less likely to attempt to break in because they will be videotaped or photographed by the cameras. When the burglars' actions are taped, law enforcement agencies are more likely to identify and arrest them. Although surveillance cameras don't prevent all burglaries or robberies, they can often deter these activities. Most businesses use a combination of security measures to secure their facilities, including door and window locks and different types of alarm systems. Businesses need and use different types of alarm systems, such as fire alarms or smoke detectors, which are often required by law. Therefore, the use of surveillance cameras does not eliminate the need for alarm systems. Extortion is blackmail and would not necessarily be impacted by surveillance cameras.

When the money supply is loose, there is more money in circulation, which means there is more money available to loan. As a result, it is less expensive to obtain credit because financial institutions charge lower interest rates in order to be competitive.

Giving rewards for performing certain activities is often an effective way to encourage employees to perform those activities. However, some employees might focus on doing only the activities for which they are rewarded rather than doing other activities that are also important. This is particularly true if the reward is in the form of a cash bonus or additional pay. As a result, routine activities may be neglected because employees are focusing on doing the activities that will increase their compensation. The reward system usually stipulates when the reward will be given, such as monthly or quarterly. Employees usually do not look for ways to avoid doing the work for which they will receive rewards. In some cases, the reward is additional compensation; however, employees do not ask for it. SOURCE:\tHR:365 SOURCE:\tLussier, R.N. (2003).

Many businesses control expenses by hiring part-time employees at an hourly rate instead of salaried, full-time employees. The advantage to the business is the same number of employees working during a given time period but for less wages. To calculate the savings, first determine the weekly payroll expense for one part-time employee by multiplying the number of hours worked each week by the hourly rate ($11.50 x 20 =$230). Then, multiply that amount by the four part-time employees ($230 x 4 = $920); and the total weekly amount by the two-week pay period ($920 x 2 = $1,840). Next, determine what the payroll would be for two full-time employees by multiplying the weekly salary by the number of employees and that amount by the two-week pay period ($575 x 2 = $1,150; $1,150 x 2 = $2,300).
