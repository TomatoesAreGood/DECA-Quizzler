To reduce the risk of nonpayment or default on a loan, a bank reviews the loan applicant's debt ratio before approving the loan. The debt ratio indicates the applicant's current level of debt in relation to his/her current assets (e.g., income, home). If the applicant has a high level of outstanding debt and few liquid assets, the applicant is more likely to default on the loan.

If the business loses the lawsuit, it may be required to pay money to the plaintiff. For example, if an employee is severely injured on the job, s/he might decide to file a lawsuit against the business for negligent behavior. If the court finds that the business acted negligently because it didn't follow safety regulations, then the business may be required to pay the employee, which is costly to the business. Acquiring insurance that offers lower premiums saves the business money and is not always related to business regulations. Customer-satisfaction levels are not always related to the business's compliance issues.

A stereotype is a set image or assumption about a person or thing. When people stereotype others, they tend to classify certain people as a group that possesses certain characteristics. These characteristics are often based on distorted beliefs or unreliable information. A person who stereotypes others often fails to see an individual who possesses unique skills, values, and attitudes. Gender is one characteristic by which people often stereotype others. Assuming men are more assertive than women in business situations is a distorted belief. In fact, many women are very assertive in business situations. Ethnic stereotyping involves having false beliefs about a person on the basis of his/her race or culture. Stereotypes about religion involve having distorted beliefs about a person's spiritual practices. An individual who stereotypes by age might feel that younger people do not possess needed knowledge or that older people are feeble and lack adaptability. SOURCE: EI:017 SOURCE: Bailey, L.J. (2007).

So, the present value of your investment is equal to $8,000 / (1 + 0.04)3 . To solve this equation, first add one to the interest rate (1 + 0.04 = 1.04). Next, raise this sum to the third power, which is the same as multiplying the sum by itself three times (1.043 = 1.04 X 1.04 X 1.04 = 1.1249). Finally, divide the future value of your investment by this product ($8,000 / 1.1249 = $7,111.75). To have $8,000 in three years, you need to invest $7,111.75 today.

Although a poor investment return, high commission fees, or the geographic location of the financial advisor's office may influence a client's decision to leave the advisor, the most common reason given for firing a financial advisor is a lack of communication. Above all else, financial clients expect\u2014and need\u2014their advisors to communicate on a regular basis. This means returning the clients' phone calls as soon as possible, replying quickly to their emails, and contacting them regularly to discuss their accounts and answer any questions that they might have.

Most businesses have specific policies that provide guidelines for the ways in which employees are expected to carry out their tasks. Following these guidelines can save the business money.

Organizations (i.e., corporations, industry/professional/trade associations) often form their own insurance companies, which are known as captive insurance companies.

If there is any concern about the assignment directions, Theresa needs to clear those up by speaking to her supervisor. Even though talking with her supervisor may delay the completion of the project, it is better to finish the assignment correctly than turn in work that doesn't meet the supervisor's intent. Theresa should submit accurate work and not expect her supervisor to fix mistakes. Restarting the assignment without clarifying the directions may lead to work that doesn't meet the supervisor's intent. Instead of emailing coworkers, Theresa needs to get clarification from the person who wrote the directions. Any input the coworkers give is simply their opinions.

However, if producers are concerned that consumers will not buy the goods in inventory, they cut back on production. This action causes the economy to contract.

Both individuals and businesses use checks to pay for goods and services such as rent, utilities, food, and supplies. When writing a check, an individual or business keeps a check register that records information about the transaction. This information includes the date the check is written, to whom the check is made payable, the amount of the check, and the check number.

When would-be burglars see surveillance cameras in several locations around a business, they are less likely to attempt to break in because they will be videotaped or photographed by the cameras. When the burglars' actions are taped, law enforcement agencies are more likely to identify and arrest them. Although surveillance cameras don't prevent all burglaries or robberies, they can often deter these activities. Most businesses use a combination of security measures to secure their facilities, including door and window locks and different types of alarm systems. Businesses need and use different types of alarm systems, such as fire alarms or smoke detectors, which are often required by law. Therefore, the use of surveillance cameras does not eliminate the need for alarm systems. Extortion is blackmail and would not necessarily be impacted by surveillance cameras.
