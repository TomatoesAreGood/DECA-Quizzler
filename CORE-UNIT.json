Regardless of whether you are writing a report, preparing for a debate, or simply learning something new for the fun of it, identifying and reading sources that provide relevant, valid information about the subject at hand is very important. If you don't use relevant, valid information, you may write, say, or learn something that is misleading or untrue. A number of criteria are commonly used to determine if certain written materials are relevant and valid. These criteria include the author's credibility, the date of publication, the publisher, etc. For instance, if you are researching federal legislation such as copyright law, you are most likely to read relevant, valid information in government publications. The government writes and enforces copyright law and other federal legislation, so government publications about these laws are most likely to be timely, accurate, complete, and on topic. People commonly express their opinions, not facts, in online discussion forums. Search engines are software programs that automatically crawl the Web looking for information pertaining to specified search terms and display a list of results.

Because there are different ways that people process information, it is important to consider those differences when providing employees with verbal directions. For example, audio learners are more comfortable with sound and dialog, so when giving directions, it is beneficial to speak clearly and use terminology that the listeners can relate to. Sometimes this involves using a metaphor or simile to make a point. Diagrams and pictures are often useful when providing directions to visual learners. For learners who are motion-oriented, demonstrating the activity often reinforces the verbal explanation and makes it easier for employees to understand. This might include an actual demonstration or a video of a demonstration.

Identity theft occurs when an individual obtains and uses another person's information (e.g., credit cards) without that person's consent. To reduce the risk of identity theft, people should use secure web browsers to make purchases. Because Internet sales transactions often require a person to provide credit card information, it is important to make sure that the web browsers are secure. Using secure websites reduces the risk of computer hackers obtaining confidential information for fraudulent purposes. Another way to reduce the risk of identity theft is to memorize passwords. If a personal planner is stolen, the risk of identity theft goes because the passwords are written down. Also, people should not share bank account numbers with others.

Health and safety are not necessarily issues to consider because most jobs in business are safe and do not adversely affect an individual's health. Individuals usually do not consider their time and money when reviewing employment opportunities. SOURCE: PD:025 SOURCE: Kimbrell, G., & Vineyard, B.S. (2006).

Employees should strive to resolve customers' complaints in a courteous and timely way. Employees should be courteous by being attentive, friendly, understanding, and apologetic if mistakes have been made. By remaining calm and handling problems in a timely (quick) and efficient way, employees often can satisfy difficult customers. An employee who responds in a leisurely way is more relaxed, and is not addressing the problem to resolve it quickly. This behavior can upset customers because they usually want problems resolved quickly. Employees who are tactless, reactive, and inefficient tend to offend and upset customers.

The brand promise is a company's agreement (spoken or unspoken) with customers that it will consistently meet their expectations and deliver on its brand characteristics and values. To build and maintain customer relationships, a company's brand promise should strive to create positive experiences for customers\u2014experiences that will encourage them to return to the business again and again. Companies use various touch points to create these experiences for their customers. Touch points are all of the opportunities that a company has to connect with its customers and reinforce its brand value. Touch points may include the company's employees, product attributes and packaging, and technological systems (e.g., telephone, website). A slogan (tag line) is a phrase that is easy to remember, such as \"Nationwide is on your side.\" A trade character is a symbol that is personified (e.g., Tony the Tiger). Businesses often use slogans and trade characters as elements of their brands. Changing slogans frequently or developing different trade characters may confuse customers, which may reduce brand recognition. One reason that businesses establish certain types of policies (e.g., sales, service) is to ensure that customers are treated fairly. Establishing different policies for different customers is not treating customers fairly, and in some circumstances, these actions are illegal. SOURCE: CR:001 SOURCE: Glatstein, S.

Credit is the arrangement by which individuals or businesses can purchase now and pay later. Many types of businesses (e.g., banks, large retailers) offer credit cards to consumers and businesses to purchase goods and services. Usually, the credit card issuer sends the credit card holder a monthly statement. The information on the statement includes a list of the purchases made during the billing cycle and the amount owed for the purchases, which includes the interest charges. If the credit card holder pays the minimum amount due, the amount of interest owed accumulates on the balance due until the debt is paid off. Because interest rates can be high, this can be a disadvantage to the credit card holder. It is important to establish a good credit rating in order to borrow money in the future from other lenders. Therefore, establishing a credit rating is not necessarily a disadvantage. Credit card holders do not earn quarterly dividends on their credit cards.

When you are willing to accept the consequences (good and bad) of your behavior, which is based on the decisions you make, you are taking responsibility for your actions. In the example, Tim admits that he made a mistake by not conducting computer backup activities, so he is accepting the responsibility for his behavior.

To further prevent identity theft, do not place your Social Security number or social insurance number on unnecessary documents. Many people do not have passports. Paying with cash is not always a good idea because cancelled bank checks serve as a receipt for payments.

As part of the evacuation plan, management may assign certain employees to conduct the head count of department members. If someone does not arrive at the meeting place, the coordinator can report the information to the appropriate person and take steps to locate the missing person. Changing smoke-alarm batteries and CPR training are not activities that will help businesses track the whereabouts of their employees during an emergency.

Skill is defined as the ability to perform a task that is developed through knowledge, training, and practice. Entrepreneurs also grow by learning to be flexible and seeking advice from others. Flexibility is the ability to adapt to changes as they occur. When entrepreneurs seek advice, they exhibit open-minded behavior. Being open-minded is the ability to see different viewpoints. Being open-minded and flexible are behaviors that successful entrepreneurs generally exhibit. Autocratic leadership is a dictatorial style of leading in which the leader determines all policies, maintains close control, and lets employees know only what they need to know in order to do the job. Possessing this form of leadership does not necessarily help entrepreneurs develop the skills they need.

Sometimes this involves using a metaphor or simile to make a point. Diagrams and pictures are often useful when providing directions to visual learners. For learners who are motion-oriented, demonstrating the activity often reinforces the verbal explanation and makes it easier for employees to understand.

A business's employees can have a dramatic impact on the ways in which customers view the business.

Therefore, a business should take steps to ensure that its employees understand how their actions affect the business's image. Businesses often develop policies to ensure that employees are engaging in behaviors that support the company's image. Because WNJ wants to project an image of being responsive to its customers' needs, it developed a policy that employees must respond to inquiries within 24 hours. This may include a quick phone call just to tell the customer that the business is working on a problem or issue. Requiring signed timecards is a personnel policy rather than a way to reinforce the business's public image.

Customer relationship management (CRM) is the combination of strategies, processes, and policies that a business uses to meet or exceed customer expectations and to provide customers with outstanding experiences at every touch point. An important aspect of CRM is ensuring that customer data are current. For example, if the customer notifies the business about a change of address and the business does not update its computer database to reflect the change, the business's promotional mailings and invoices will not reach the customer in a timely manner, if at all. In another situation, a business might have multiple database records for one customer. If the business sends multiple (excessive) copies of promotional materials (e.g., product catalog) to the customer based on the data in the database, the customer may become annoyed. Sending multiple copies of a single mailing to one customer is also a waste of the business's money.

The business cycle refers to the periods of expansion and contraction in economic conditions. When the economy is strong and growing (expansion), businesses tend to make profits, expand operations, and hire more employees.

Prevents armed robberies"], "answer": "B", "reasoning": "Discourages attempted burglaries. When would-be burglars see surveillance cameras in several locations around a business, they are less likely to attempt to break in because they will be video-taped or photographed by the cameras. When the burglars' actions are taped, law enforcement agencies are more likely to identify and arrest them. Although surveillance cameras don't prevent all burglaries or robberies, they can often deter these activities. Most businesses use a combination of security measures to secure their facilities, including door and window locks and different types of alarm systems. Businesses need and use different types of alarm systems, such as fire alarms or smoke detectors, which are often required by law. Therefore, the use of surveillance cameras does not eliminate the need for alarm systems. Extortion is blackmail and would not necessarily be impacted by surveillance cameras.

The grapevine is an informal method of communication. It often provides accurate, positive information, but it can also communicate negative, distorted, or incorrect information or rumors. For example, employees who hear and spread rumors about layoffs or salary cuts may not have sent or received accurate or complete information. If management does not address the rumors, they can cause friction and anxiety in the workplace. To combat rumors, management can take steps by communicating regularly with its employees through e-mail, newsletters, memos, and meetings. By addressing rumors and responding honestly before the rumors get out of hand, employees are more likely to trust and respect management, and listen less to the negative communication that travels through the grapevine. In some situations, managers may not legally be able to talk about issues, but it is important that they acknowledge the situation and explain why they cannot comment. Successful businesses depend on employees who collaborate, so limiting their contact is a detrimental and unrealistic option.

Torts are civil wrongdoings that cause harm or injury to another party. Appropriation, wrongful interference, defamation, and conversion are four kinds of torts. Appropriation, which Brix Beauty Salon committed, involves a business or person who uses\u2014without permission\u2014another person's name, likeness, and other unique characteristics for the benefit or gain of the user. Brix Beauty Salon used the celebrity's name and picture to attract customers to the salon. Unfortunately, Brix had not obtained permission to use the celebrity's name or likeness. As a result, the celebrity could sue Brix for appropriation. Wrongful interference consists of predatory behavior undertaken by a business to draw either customers or employees away from a competitor. Defamation involves making false, malicious statements about a person or organization. Conversion occurs when personal property is taken from the owner and given to someone else to use.

In other words, these statutes control the agencies' activities. The government wields political control over these agencies by providing (or withholding) funding, by approving (or speaking out against) individuals nominated to lead these agencies, and by amending the agencies' enabling legislation. The courts can also control federal agencies by reviewing and deciding the legality of the agencies' actions. Finally, the public can indirectly control federal agencies through information. Most federal agencies are required to provide the public with information on different topics.

In some economic systems (e.g., communist command), the government controls practically all of the means of production and distribution. In other economic systems (e.g., open market), businesses and individuals are primarily responsible for production and distribution. In open market economic systems, the government regulates business activities to protect consumers and provide a fair competitive environment among businesses.

Before selecting a broker, it's vital that you thoroughly understand his/her payment structure. Many brokers (especially full-service brokers) are paid on commission, which means they make money every time they conduct a transaction for you. A good broker is reliable and has your best interests at heart when recommending that you buy or sell certain securities. Unfortunately, a dishonest broker may encourage you to make excessive trades just to collect the commission fees from each one. This practice is called churning. Skimming is a price strategy that involves setting prices higher than those of the competition.

Positioning innovation occurs when the purpose or use of a product is changed. Play-Doh was originally sold for one purpose (wallpaper cleaner) and is now used in another way (children's art and craft medium); therefore, positioning innovation has occurred. Paradigm innovation occurs when there is a significant change in thinking. The evolution of the personal computer is an example of paradigm innovation. Creative destruction is a term coined by Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter to describe how new goods and services can hurt existing goods and services. Obsolescence is the process of becoming outdated due to the introduction of new products, processes, and/or technology. In the example, the compound originally sold as wallpaper cleaner became outdated when vinyl wallpaper was invented because vinyl wallpaper can be cleaned with soap and water. However, the obsolescence that occurred was not planned. Planned obsolescence most often occurs today with technological products.

Leave-me-alone customers are people who refuse to accept help from sales representatives, even when they are confused or need assistance. Domineering customers like to be in control. They often give orders to salespeople even if they don't know what they are talking about. Suspicious customers ask questions such as \u201cAre you sure there are no bed bugs in this hotel?\u201d and \u201cI want to be certain I won't be charged for extra towels.\u201d The customer in this example is best described as insulting.

Association refers to the method of identifying relationships between different variables or data items in large databases, and it is useful when trying to forecast. Clustering is the process of discovering groups (or clusters) of data and categorizing data that are identical in some way into the same class.

Identifying which tasks are important and which are urgent can help you better manage your time throughout the workday.
