The purpose of writing persuasive messages is to convince customers to do something such as buy a product or pay an overdue bill. To encourage them to take the correct action, it is important to appeal to their needs and show them why it is a benefit to do what you want them to do. For example, if you want customers to buy a new product, explain how that product will benefit them, such as by saving money or speeding up production. Customers are more likely to respond favorably when they understand how their needs will be satisfied, and they will benefit from taking action. Customers usually are not interested in the business's point of view or predictions for the future unless those predictions will benefit them. Persuasive messages are more effective if they explain how customers will benefit rather than explaining the technical aspects in detail.

Jim's conduct is an example of aggressive behavior which is based on a willingness to ignore the rights of others and to take advantage of them in order to achieve personal goals.

When a project manager reviews an inventory-status report to determine if enough supplies are available, s/he is monitoring resources, which is a controlling activity. Determining what will be accomplished is a planning activity. Coordinating tasks is an organizing activity. Reviewing the qualifications of project-team candidates is a staffing activity.

Risk management is a business activity that involves the planning, controlling, preventing, and procedures to limit business losses. An important aspect of risk management involves complying with laws. If a business does not comply with laws, then it may be sued or fined, which could result in substantial financial losses. A failure to comply with laws may also affect the business's credibility with its customers. Therefore, it is important for a business to continuously monitor government regulations to ensure that it is in compliance, and make changes, if necessary, to become compliant. Monitoring competitors' activities, judicial opinions, and social etiquette will not reduce risks associated with noncompliance.

For example, the level of group input needed for decision making depends on the business's type, size, structure, and policies.

Workers have the right to not be discriminated against in the workplace. This applies to hiring new employees as well as the treatment of current employees. For example, workers should have equal opportunities for advancement and not be discriminated against in the promotion process simply because they are female. Flexible work schedules are offered by some businesses, but that is not a right that workers should expect. Employees are entitled to a certain amount of personal time but not unlimited personal time. Employees usually have access to only the company information that they need in order to do their jobs.

A job promotion occurs when an employee advances to another position that often provides the individual with increased responsibility and compensation as well as a new job title. Companies often provide their employees with opportunities to advance within the organization because they are familiar with many aspects of the organization (e.g., products, climate). A company that creates a new department needs people to carry out the work. Therefore, the new department provides an opportunity for advancement for current employees. When a partner leaves a partnership, the partnership generally dissolves and requires legal restructuring. Temporary workers are individuals who work on a short-term basis to carry out a business's tasks and objectives. Although some temporary employees secure permanent positions, it does not necessarily mean that they are placed in different positions.

Listing critical activities often helps employees prioritize and plan their work, which can help them achieve their deadlines. Routine tasks, such as checking e-mail, are performed on a regular basis and often do not require a lot of time or thought. Accomplishments are things that have been achieved. Long-term goals are objectives that will take a year or more to reach. SOURCE: OP:228 SOURCE: McFarland, A. (2006, June 14). How to prioritize your work.

It is easier to manage vendor relationships when a company works with a small group of vendors. When the company works with fewer vendors, it has more time to cultivate long-term relationships with each vendor.

Working with a few vendors does not always provide the business with a wider product selection. A disadvantage to working with a few vendors is that supply interruptions are more likely to affect the company because it may not have easy access to another source that sells similar goods or services.

Employees who do not follow the business's ethics guidelines may cross a legal line without knowing they have done so.

By providing an ethics-training program, the business can advise its employees about its expectations in relation to workplace behavior. Because an employee's personal ethics may differ from the organization's ethics, it is important for the employees to have a clear understanding of the business's expectations. When employees don't have a clear understanding of the business's expectations, they put the business at risk. Businesses cannot assume that employees know their expectations. Employees who do not follow the business's ethics guidelines may cross a legal line without knowing they have done so. If employees cross ethical lines and break the law, the business may experience fines and obtain unfavorable publicity.

Weekly status meetings may improve work quality because the updates may identify problems that require corrective action. Long-term goals do not tend to lead to lower performance quality in the workplace. SOURCE: EI:077 SOURCE: Wright, B. (2008, August 27). Avoiding overcommitment: Knowing when to say no.

Interviewing job applicants is a staffing activity. Coordinating tasks is an organizing activity. Recommending changes is a controlling activity. SOURCE: SM:066 SOURCE: Yu, M. (2010, March 5).

Taking steps to minimize barriers, such as closing a door, or letting a phone call go to voice mail can decrease distractions and improve active listening.

Customer relationship management (CRM) is the combination of strategies, processes, and policies that a business uses to meet or exceed customer expectations and to provide customers with outstanding experiences at every touch point. An important aspect of CRM is ensuring that customer data are current. For example, if the customer notifies the business about a change of address and the business does not update its computer database to reflect the change, the business's promotional mailings and invoices will not reach the customer in a timely manner, if at all. In another situation, a business might have multiple database records for one customer. If the business sends multiple (excessive) copies of promotional materials (e.g., product catalog) to the customer based on the data in the database, the customer may become annoyed. Sending multiple copies of a single mailing to one customer is also a waste of the business's money. To maintain the customer's privacy, the business should not post customer information on its website, nor should it allow its employees to have complete access to a customer's confidential information.

Although collaboration and cooperation among individuals can be used to achieve a common goal, groupthink conditions can be detrimental to ethical decision making. Groupthink is an extreme form of cohesiveness in which all members of the group strive for unanimity (harmony) at any cost. This condition stifles independent thinking and objectivity. Group members who question another member's idea or action may be censored or cut off by the group majority. In addition, individuals begin to self-censor, which means they quiet their own conflicting thoughts for the \"good of the group.\" Groupthink can erode personal ethics and lead group members to do things they normally wouldn't do. In today's competitive business environment, the pressure to earn high profits has often resulted in fraudulent behavior, embezzlement, money laundering, etc. Such actions are often a result of groupthink conditions. Empathy is the ability to place oneself in another person's place or circumstances. Empathy is not a characteristic of groupthink, which embraces harmonious or like-minded thinking.

The law of diminishing returns states that when increasing amounts of one factor (clothing racks, in this case) are employed, holding all other factors constant, after some point, the resulting increase in output (sales, in this case) becomes smaller and smaller. In this scenario, this may be because more racks make the store crowded, and consumers had trouble viewing the merchandise. While the store has competitors, its decision to add racks of merchandise does not take competitors into consideration. While the store likely is operating in a private enterprise system, the declining sales increase caused by another clothing rack is not explained by that concept.

Economies of scale is the reduction in cost per unit resulting from increased production, realized through operational efficiencies. This scenario does not deal with the cost of the clothing.

", "choices": ["A. structural ", "B. frictional ", "C. cyclical", "D. seasonal"], "answer": "A", "reasoning": "Structural. Structural unemployment occurs when workers' skills don't match up with the jobs available. This often happens when there are technological advances, like in Randy's situation. Although he is a skilled worker, the jobs available need a different set of skills. In Randy's case, his best option is to get more education or training so he will have the necessary skills to become employed again. Frictional unemployment occurs when the right jobs and workers just haven't been matched up. Unlike with structural employment, there is a job that utilizes the employee's skills, but s/he just hasn't found it yet. Cyclical unemployment happens when there's an overall decline in the economy. For example, when a recession hits, fewer people are able to find employment. This is not the case for Randy, as there are plenty of jobs. He just doesn't have the skills necessary for any of them.

A weak dollar is a dollar that's worth less than another (foreign) currency. A weak dollar creates many disadvantages for the economy, but one advantage is that it encourages exports. A weak dollar means that foreign currency is able to buy more goods. A weak dollar actually creates less consumer spending because imported products become more expensive, meaning that consumers can't afford to buy as much.

The best way to save money on maintenance is to make sure you do it regularly. It's always cheaper to prevent a problem than it is to fix it. By creating a schedule and then sticking to it, you'll reduce the chance of equipment breakdowns. This can save you money in repairs and unexpected downtime. Instead of allowing only outside technicians to maintain equipment, it's better to train everyone in the office to follow the maintenance schedule. This way, when you run into problems, anyone at your company will be able to fix the equipment, and you won't have to spend the money to call in an outside technician. Although it's tempting to use the cheapest supplies you can find, sometimes you really do get what you pay for. Cheaper supplies often end up breaking down faster, so it's best to focus on quality. Cleaning and repairing equipment only when you absolutely have to can lead to unexpected problems and breakdowns\u2014it's better to stick to a schedule and make maintenance a part of your everyday routine.

When customers visit the business to buy the low-priced items, they are told that those items are sold out. This is unethical because the business never had the low-priced items and advertised them only to attract customers with the intention of selling them higher priced items.

A whistleblower is a worker who reports his/her employer's unlawful activities to a government agency or to a media outlet. Some governments have laws in place to protect whistleblowers from retaliation (e.g., demotion, dismissal) from their employers. When a person reports that his/her employer is disposing of waste in an unsafe manner, s/he is a whistleblower. Filing a complaint about a neighbor's noise level is a civil procedure, rather than a workplace issue. Plea bargaining occurs when a defendant agrees to disclose certain information or conduct a certain activity in exchange for a lesser penalty. Generally, witnesses to accidents are not in a position where plea bargaining is necessary. Laws restrict healthcare providers from disclosing a patient's medical information.

References are letters of recommendation that usually accompany job applications. Supervisors try to earn the respect and approval of their employees, but they do not ask for it.

Misuse of copyrighted material is a serious problem for businesses when other countries do not honor a nation's copyright laws. To combat these practices, businesses and industry organizations can lobby their governments to take action against countries in which piracy is a common practice. As a result of the lobbying efforts, a country's government knows about the problem, and can apply pressure to encourage the other nation's government to take action to stop the piracy. Actions such as trade sanctions and refusing membership into world organizations send a strong message to these nations that the behavior of the businesses in their countries is not acceptable. The International Delphi Convention is not a world organization that handles international lawsuits. A business that reorganizes its distribution channels is not necessarily going to prevent international piracy practices. Piracy occurs when another person or company uses copyrighted material without the owner's authorization.

If it adds another employee, production might increase slightly but profitability would decrease.

Before starting a new business, owners develop a business plan in order to establish objectives, outline the steps to take to achieve the objectives, and estimate financial needs.

Many businesses hire employees to create or invent goods and services to sell. A patent legally provides the owner the sole rights of the new product for a certain amount of time. When an employee invents a product as a part of his/her job duties, ownership rights generally belong to the employer. To further protect the business's legal ownership of the invention, it is best for employers to have employees sign an invention assignment agreement at the time of hire. This agreement is a document that transfers invention ownership from the inventor (employee) to the employer. The government issues patents rather than a trade association. Applying for a utility patent does not automatically transfer patent ownership rights.

It is important for a business's management team to monitor all aspects of the business so it can maintain or exceed the quality level that its customers expect. If quality decreases, the business may lose customers to its competitors. An important part of monitoring quality is soliciting input from the workers who are actually performing the tasks, because they often have ideas that will help them do their jobs with more efficiency. Ongoing communication is necessary for continuous quality improvement because unexpected issues might occur that affect quality, and management needs to know so the problems can be fixed. Continuous quality improvement usually occurs in small increments over time. The number of changes is dependent on the business's goals.

There are many ways that businesses can control their operating expenses. One of these is to lease equipment rather than buy it. Businesses often are able to lease equipment and pay for it on a monthly basis over a period of time, which saves paying the purchase price in one lump sum. Also, leased equipment can be returned at the end of the lease agreement and replaced with new equipment, which often saves the business repair expense. Sometimes, businesses need specialized equipment for a certain project, and it is more economical to lease it for a short time than to buy equipment that will not be needed again. Buying in small quantities is often more costly than buying in large quantities. Obtaining credit does not control expenses because a business must repay the loan with interest. Organizing inventory space does not necessarily help to control operating expenses. SOURCE: OP:029 SOURCE: Meyer, E.C., & Allen, K.R. (2000).
