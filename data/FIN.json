One technique people use to improve listening skills is to make a conscious effort to try to focus and remember what the speaker says. Staying focused on the message and filtering out noise as much as possible improves the chances of remembering and accurately understanding the message.

However, monitoring one's own nonverbal cues does not necessarily mean that the listener takes control of the conversation. Asking questions during the speaker's message does not necessarily reduce listening blocks or barriers.

Sometimes, businesses experience temporary or short-term cash-flow problems when the anticipated inflow of cash falls short. When this type of situation occurs, the business needs to determine how to handle it. To do this, the business needs to carefully monitor its cash flow, so it can plan how and when it will pay its bills. XTY should pay Vendor C first because it is the oldest invoice that hasn't been paid. A business's credit rating can be negatively affected if the business does not pay its bills within a reasonable amount of time. Although Vendor B's bill was due five days ago, the business is probably within its payment grace period with the vendor. The bills that are not yet due should be paid after the overdue bill is paid.

When employees exhibit unethical behavior, it places employers at risk. Risk might include financial losses related to theft, embezzlement, government fines, and lawsuits. To lower risk, businesses should implement procedures that encourage employees to report workplace misconduct. By providing a way to report misconduct to management, the business can take corrective action to prevent further unethical behavior. Businesses develop policies to maintain a fair environment. If employees can change policies at anytime, the risk of unethical activity increases. Some records, such as personnel files and customer financial data, are confidential, and should not be available for all employees to view. Using company resources (e.g., expensive equipment) can increase risk because untrained employees may break or misuse the equipment. SOURCE: RM:041 SOURCE: Ebersole, G. (n.d.).

To remain viable in the marketplace, a business must take steps to minimize risk. One internal control that businesses use to minimize risk is to maintain accurate financial records. Businesses must comply with government regulations (e.g., pay taxes). If the business fails to comply with the regulations, it could be subject to penalties and fines that can be very costly to the business. By maintaining accurate financial records, businesses can minimize these types of risks. If the business orders too much inventory, it risks financial loss on the products that it cannot move. If the business implements lenient credit policies, it increases risks associated with delinquent and nonpaying customers. Substandard equipment may be prone to malfunctioning, and may be hazardous for employees, which increases the business's risk levels. SOURCE: RM:058 SOURCE: International Federation of Accountants.

Risk management is a business activity that involves the planning, controlling, preventing, and procedures to limit business losses. An important aspect of risk management involves complying with laws. If a business does not comply with laws, then it may face a lawsuit. If the business loses the lawsuit, it may be required to pay money to the plaintiff. For example, if an employee is severely injured on the job, s/he might decide to file a lawsuit against the business for negligent behavior. If the court finds that the business acted negligently because it didn't follow safety regulations, then the business may be required to pay the employee, which is costly to the business.

Three common types of financial statement analysis are vertical analysis, horizontal analysis, and ratio analysis. When conducting vertical analysis, an individual calculates each individual item on a financial statement as a percentage of the total. After doing so, the analyst can develop common-size financial statements that allow him/her to compare performance across several years for a single company or across several different companies. Horizontal analysis, which is sometimes known as trend analysis, involves analyzing dollar amounts on financial statements for a single company across several years. Horizontal analysis does not involve the development of common-size financial statements. Ratio analysis involves the calculation of ratios based on a company's financial data.

Next, raise this sum to the third power, which is the same as multiplying the sum by itself three times (1.043 = 1.04 X 1.04 X 1.04 = 1.1249).

A company's image, or brand, is the way a person or group views the company; it's the combined impressions and experiences associated with the company.

To reinforce the upscale image, the business might require an employee to greet the customer in a certain way, provide extra amenities, wear certain apparel, or follow certain cleaning procedures to maintain the facility. Although it is important for a business to develop a financial plan, conduct a competitive analysis, and identify necessary resources, these activities do not directly affect how employees convey a certain image.

Interest is the amount of money the investment issuer pays an investor for using the investor's money. Depending on the type of investment (e.g., savings account), interest is compounded at certain intervals (e.g., daily, quarterly, annually), which means that interest is earned upon the previous interest amount earned. In the example, the interest is compounded annually. To determine the value of Amelia's savings account after two years, first calculate the interest earned after the first year. Do this by multiplying the savings account deposit amount by the interest percentage rate, then add the interest amount earned to the savings account deposit amount ($250 x .0625 or 6.25% = $15.63; $250 + 15.63 = $265.63). After one year, the money is worth $265.63. Now, the interest begins to compound, and you must determine the value of the money in the savings account at the end of the second year. Do this by multiplying the savings account balance (amount) at the end of the first year by the interest percentage rate ($265.63 x .0625 or 6.25% = $16.60).

Governments develop and enforce various regulations to protect the well-being of society. If a business is not following safety regulations, it is not protecting the well-being of its employees and customers. An employee should report the noncompliance so the government can step in and ensure that the business takes corrective action before an accident occurs and someone is injured. By reporting noncompliance of safety regulations, the employee may prevent a tragedy from occurring and prevent the business from receiving poor publicity and a bad reputation that would likely result from an accident or injury. Although it depends on the type of product, it is often legal for a business to sell substitute goods to consumers.

In the example, the company's stock values are likely to be affected by the problems with a new product.

The magic of compounding is earning interest upon interest. Compounding takes place any time you earn interest, but its effects are most dramatic when you're investing. Key factors involved in compounding growth are the amount of money invested, how long the money is invested, and how much the investment grows each year. With the stock market's average yearly gain of 10 percent, after one year, Cheryl's $6,000 was $6,600. With the same 10 percent return the next year, Cheryl's $6,600 turned into $7,260. She earned interest on her interest. Phishing is an online identity-theft scam that fools its victims into believing they are submitting sensitive personal information to a legitimate website. To diversify means to spread out your investment dollars among a number of different securities. Market timing is a form of the \"buy low and sell high\" trading strategy, in which investors purchase securities at low prices and sell them at high prices to profit from the difference.

Budgeting software, which is generally much more sophisticated than standard spreadsheet software, allows business owners and managers to study each item in a budget individually as well as together as a whole. Owners and managers can see the impact that different actions have on a business's budget, both before and after these actions take place. The software also allows them to pinpoint business units/products that are underperforming and helps them to determine suitable corrective action. Creating line-item projections using standard spreadsheet software can be extremely time-consuming, but budgeting applications shorten the process considerably. Spreadsheet software also makes it difficult to adapt to unexpected events and changing economic conditions, while budgeting software is much more nimble. Therefore, budgets prepared with budgeting-specific software are much easier and simpler to modify.

While withholding pertinent information from or misrepresenting information to insurance underwriters may help risk managers to obtain unfairly favorable premium rates from insurers in the short-term, doing so is highly unethical and likely to cause problems in the long-term, such as when the company attempts to renew the policy.

", "choices": ["A. cyclical", "B. frictional", "C. structural", "D. seasonal"], "answer": "C", "reasoning": "Structural. Structural unemployment occurs when workers' skills don't match up with the jobs available. This often happens when there are technological advances, like in Randy's situation. Although he is a skilled worker, the jobs available need a different set of skills. In Randy's case, his best option is to get more education or training so he will have the necessary skills to become employed again. Frictional unemployment occurs when the right jobs and workers just haven't been matched up. Unlike with structural employment, there is a job that utilizes the employee's skills, but s/he just hasn't found it yet. Cyclical unemployment happens when there's an overall decline in the economy.

Geographic segmentation involves dividing a market on the basis of location (e.g., zip code). Demographics are the physical and social characteristics of the population. A business that segments the market on the basis of demographics considers factors such as the age, gender, and ethnicity of the population. Rate of usage is a type of behavioral segmentation, which involves dividing customers into groups according to their response to a product. SOURCE: MP:003 SOURCE: LAP-MP-003\u2014Have We Met?

Gary favors a progressive tax structure. A progressive tax structure is one in which those who earn more are required to pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. In other words, as the income increases, the tax rate also increases. The U.S. income tax is a progressive tax. If using a regressive tax structure, people who earn more income pay a lower percentage of income in taxes. As income increases, the tax rate decreases. Sales and excise taxes are considered to be regressive taxes, because people with lower incomes ultimately pay a larger percentage of their income in sales and excise taxes.

Horizontal analyses compare the information from a single company's income statements over multiple years. This allows analysts to determine trends and make forecasts for future performance. Vertical analyses are used in comparing companies within the same industry, even companies of vastly different sizes. This is because a vertical analysis of an income statement results in the calculation of multiple ratios, which are more easily compared across multiple companies of different sizes than are dollars. Leverage analyses are effective at determining company performance by resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio. These are typically performed with income statement information for a single year. Liquidity analyses are performed with information from a company's balance sheet to determine if a company is able to meet its short-term debts.

To reduce the risk of unauthorized access to confidential information, businesses often assign computer passwords to allow authorized employees to view secured information. This reduces the risk of confidential information getting into the wrong hands. Encryption, rather than decryption, is a way to protect information. Encryption is the process of transforming information into a secret code so that unauthorized users are not able to read it. Groupware applications are software programs that allow several computer users to access the same information from different locations. Spooling is the process of transferring computer data to a temporary location so the data can be retrieved and processed through a different computer program.

Risk management is a business activity that involves the planning, controlling, preventing, and procedures to limit business losses. An important aspect of risk management involves complying with laws. If a business does not comply with laws, then it may face a lawsuit. If the business loses the lawsuit, it may be required to pay money to the plaintiff. For example, if an employee is severely injured on the job, s/he might decide to file a lawsuit against the business for negligent behavior. If the court finds that the business acted negligently because it didn't follow safety regulations, then the business may be required to pay the employee, which is costly to the business. Acquiring insurance that offers lower premiums saves the business money and is not always related to business regulations. Customer-satisfaction levels are not always related to the business's compliance issues.

Cash flow, liquidity, profitability, and liability are examples of metrics that are often included on a financial scorecard. Rather than simply listing data on the scorecard, business employees can use financial analysis applications to develop charts and graphs that present the data in much more readily understandable ways. A profit-andloss statement is a summary of business transactions that shows net profit before and after taxes by analyzing sales, purchases, cost of goods sold, and operating expenses for a specified period. While Lawrence's financial scorecard probably contains information that also appears on the company's profitand-loss statement, the financial scorecard presents additional financial metrics. Cost standards are established specifications used to measure how much a project or product costs. An operating agreement is a written document signed by members of a limited liability partnership or limited liability company that specifies the terms of the business arrangement.

They have more money to spend, but the goods and services they want cost more than their pay increase. The employees' take-home pay increases although it will not buy the same level of goods and services because of the higher inflation rate. When inflation is high, interest rates usually increase. A small rise in inflation will not necessarily affect employment levels. SOURCE:\tEC:081 SOURCE:\tArnold, R.A. (2004). Economics (6th ed.) [pp. 134, 180].

The owner may be able to borrow part of that amount to obtain capital.

Then, subtract the two-week, part-time payroll from the two-week, full-time payroll to determine the amount the business will save ($2,300 - $1,840 = $460). SOURCE:\tOP:029 SOURCE:\tBizMove.com.
