Businesses usually are prevented from entering into legally binding contracts with certain groups of people because these people are not considered to have the capacity to understand the consequences of their actions.

The debtor is the individual or business that owes money to another individual or business, which is the creditor.

A monetary gift is given without expectations of repayment. A monetary gift and a request for information are not examples of debtor-creditor relationships.

It involves creating positive change through hard work over the long term. For example, Martin Luther King, Jr. had a vision in which his children would have equal rights with all Americans. His vision was to end racism, and he took many steps to make his vision come true. Due to his efforts, peoples' attitudes changed and laws were established to protect and ensure all peoples' rights, which created permanent results from his vision. When working toward a personal vision, a person may experience setbacks and challenges, such as limited resources.

Risk management is a business activity that involves the planning, controlling, preventing, and procedures to limit business losses. An important aspect of risk management involves complying with laws. If a business does not comply with laws, then it may face a lawsuit. If the business loses the lawsuit, it may be required to pay money to the plaintiff. For example, if an employee is severely injured on the job, s/he might decide to file a lawsuit against the business for negligent behavior. If the court finds that the business acted negligently because it didn't follow safety regulations, then the business may be required to pay the employee, which is costly to the business. Acquiring insurance that offers lower premiums saves the business money and is not always related to business regulations. Customer-satisfaction levels are not always related to the business's compliance issues.

Many people use brainstorming to come up with ideas to resolve conflicts. Brainstorming is a creative-thinking technique involving the identification of as many different ideas as possible during a certain time frame. Debating is disagreeing. Deciding is choosing among alternatives. Mediating is a process that involves asking a neutral third party to help resolve a conflict. It is not considered a creative solution.

Customers' invoices provide information about an individual customer's buying preferences and habits.

In sales promotion, coupons are a type of communications channel that are used to provide information about products to customers. The reason for using coupons is to generate an immediate response by offering reduced prices on specific items. The hope is that customers will be motivated to buy the product now because of the information they received. Sales promotion is usually intended to encourage a quick response, while advertising is intended to create long-term demand and persuade customers to remain loyal. Sales promotion involves promotional activities other than advertising. SOURCE: PR:249 SOURCE: Farese, L.S., Kimbrell, G., & Woloszyk, C.A. (2012). Marketing essentials (pp. 405-411).

Salespeople strive to develop and maintain positive relationships with customers to keep them as customers. Effective salespeople know that customers expect more than just a product when they purchase something. The salespeople who are able to provide excellent service for their customers are usually able to maintain positive selling relationships with them.
