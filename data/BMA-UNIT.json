The purpose of writing persuasive messages is to convince customers to do something such as buy a product or pay an overdue bill. To encourage them to take the correct action, it is important to appeal to their needs and show them why it is a benefit to do what you want them to do. For example, if you want customers to buy a new product, explain how that product will benefit them, such as by saving money or speeding up production. Customers are more likely to respond favorably when they understand how their needs will be satisfied, and they will benefit from taking action. Customers usually are not interested in the business's point of view or predictions for the future unless those predictions will benefit them. Persuasive messages are more effective if they explain how customers will benefit rather than explaining the technical aspects in detail.

Jim's conduct is an example of aggressive behavior which is based on a willingness to ignore the rights of others and to take advantage of them in order to achieve personal goals.

When a project manager reviews an inventory-status report to determine if enough supplies are available, s/he is monitoring resources, which is a controlling activity. Determining what will be accomplished is a planning activity. Coordinating tasks is an organizing activity. Reviewing the qualifications of project-team candidates is a staffing activity.

Risk management is a business activity that involves the planning, controlling, preventing, and procedures to limit business losses. An important aspect of risk management involves complying with laws. If a business does not comply with laws, then it may be sued or fined, which could result in substantial financial losses. A failure to comply with laws may also affect the business's credibility with its customers. Therefore, it is important for a business to continuously monitor government regulations to ensure that it is in compliance, and make changes, if necessary, to become compliant. Monitoring competitors' activities, judicial opinions, and social etiquette will not reduce risks associated with noncompliance.

For example, the level of group input needed for decision making depends on the business's type, size, structure, and policies.

For example, workers should have equal opportunities for advancement and not be discriminated against in the promotion process simply because they are female. Flexible work schedules are offered by some businesses, but that is not a right that workers should expect. Employees are entitled to a certain amount of personal time but not unlimited personal time. Employees usually have access to only the company information that they need in order to do their jobs.

A job promotion occurs when an employee advances to another position that often provides the individual with increased responsibility and compensation as well as a new job title. Companies often provide their employees with opportunities to advance within the organization because they are familiar with many aspects of the organization (e.g., products, climate). A company that creates a new department needs people to carry out the work. Therefore, the new department provides an opportunity for advancement for current employees. When a partner leaves a partnership, the partnership generally dissolves and requires legal restructuring. Temporary workers are individuals who work on a short-term basis to carry out a business's tasks and objectives.

After she picks up her rental car, Susan wants to meet with Jana early Monday afternoon. Jana knows that meetings with her boss tend to last longer than expected, and that Susan will have a 45-minute drive from the airport to her office.

Managing your commitments in a timely manner means that you allow yourself enough time to complete important tasks. An important aspect of allowing yourself enough time to complete tasks is making sure that you \"pad\" your time in case unexpected situations occur that require immediate attention. In Jana's case, she has several important commitments in one day. It is important for Jana to meet with the Susan because she could provide the business with needed financial support. The best way for Jana to handle the situation is to suggest they meet for lunch between the airport and Jana's office at 1:15. This way, if Jana's meeting with her boss goes a few minutes longer than expected, she still has time to arrive for her meeting with Susan on time. Susan will have a rental car, so transportation is not an issue for her. It may not be convenient for Susan to meet with Jana the following week. Because Susan arrives at 11:30 a.m. and has a 45-minute drive from the airport, she could not meet at Jana's office at noon. A late meeting at the airport will not allow Jana enough time to get back to the office to lead her videoconference at 4:30. SOURCE: EI:077 SOURCE: Time Management. (n.d.).

All credit cards charge an annual percentage rate on the unpaid balance, and some offer a low rate for a short period of time to attract new customers. Some credit cards also charge an annual fee. Then, there are fees for late payment and for cash advances. It is necessary to compare the costs to determine the best offer rather than accept a credit card that has a high interest rate, a high annual fee, and high fees for penalties. The wise use of credit does not involve comparing the various offers of credit to determine the affiliated banks or company sponsors. Credit-card fees and costs are not taxes.

Business analysis is the process of investigating and evaluating a business issue, problem, process, or approach. Businesses analyze a variety of areas that affect their operations, including activities that relate to the human-resources management function. Because the humanresources management function is responsible for finding and hiring skilled workers, it must determine the appropriate pay for those workers, which can be done by reviewing external data gathered from government and industry reports. Information can also be obtained by reviewing other companies' job postings and pay scales, if available. Calculating break-even points is a pricing activity.

Customer relationship management (CRM) is the combination of strategies, processes, and policies that a business uses to meet or exceed customer expectations and to provide customers with outstanding experiences at every touch point. An important aspect of CRM is ensuring that customer data are current. For example, if the customer notifies the business about a change of address and the business does not update its computer database to reflect the change, the business's promotional mailings and invoices will not reach the customer in a timely manner, if at all. In another situation, a business might have multiple database records for one customer. If the business sends multiple (excessive) copies of promotional materials (e.g., product catalog) to the customer based on the data in the database, the customer may become annoyed. Sending multiple copies of a single mailing to one customer is also a waste of the business's money. To maintain the customer's privacy, the business should not post customer information on its website, nor should it allow its employees to have complete access to a customer's confidential information.

By thinking about what may happen if a task is not completed, you are evaluating the importance of the task, which helps you prioritize your work. For example, suppose your manager needs a status report from you for a meeting that is scheduled two hours from now. If you don't have the report ready on time, your manager will not have the information to present during the meeting, which will make him/her unprepared. As a result, your manager is likely to become upset with you. On the other hand, suppose you need to write a letter of recommendation for a student who did an internship with your company. The student doesn't need the letter until next week. So, if you don't write the letter today, it isn't going to cause a problem for your intern.

It's important to make your persuasive letter as objective as possible. Of course, you want your reader to know how great your product is, but you don't want him/her to think that you're biased. If s/he does, s/he may dismiss your letter. It's important to use specific words and active voice. Specific facts show the reader exactly what your product can do, while active voice makes your letter stand out and seem more urgent. While you want your letter to grab the reader's attention, it's important to stay honest. Don't exaggerate just to seem more exciting. Your reader will likely be able to tell, and it may turn her/him off your product. SOURCE: CO:031 SOURCE: Jonas, R. (2009, May 12). Persuasive messages: Chapter 7.

An analytical report is a document that explains and evaluates an issue, opportunity, or problem. Often, the analytical report includes recommendations for a business to take a certain course of action. If the writer anticipates that most members of the audience are receptive and will agree with the recommendations, then using a direct approach to structure the report is optimal. The direct approach involves writing the report so it focuses the attention on the conclusions and recommendations. If the writer anticipates a skeptical, argumentative, or indecisive audience, the indirect approach may be the best way to structure the report. The indirect approach involves preparing a logical argument that supports the recommendations and focuses on the rationale behind the recommendations.

The British tend to be more formal in business situations, and they like a wide range of space. They tend to shake hands as a greeting rather than embrace and kiss.

Although collaboration and cooperation among individuals can be used to achieve a common goal, groupthink conditions can be detrimental to ethical decision making. Groupthink is an extreme form of cohesiveness in which all members of the group strive for unanimity (harmony) at any cost. This condition stifles independent thinking and objectivity. Group members who question another member's idea or action may be censored or cut off by the group majority. In addition, individuals begin to self-censor, which means they quiet their own conflicting thoughts for the \"good of the group.\" Groupthink can erode personal ethics and lead group members to do things they normally wouldn't do.

Preventive control occurs before a business activity is performed. Preventive control often involves establishing standards and procedures for carrying out the activity. An external control strategy is based on a management philosophy in which employees are motivated primarily by external rewards (e. g., bonuses, and awards). SOURCE: SM:004 SOURCE: DuBrin, A. (2009).

A community of practice is an informal group that is formed by people who have common interests. In communities of practice, group members share ideas, discuss problems, and brainstorm solutions. By doing so, the group members are transferring their knowledge among themselves. One or all members can capture and record the collected knowledge for future personal or group use. In the example, Jack and his friends share a common bond because all of them work in technology. When the group met, Jack's friends offered suggestions for resolving his work dilemma; therefore, the group is a community of practice. Groupthink is a situation that occurs when conforming to the group becomes more important than expressing individual judgment and ideas. A strategic alliance is an arrangement that involves two or more businesses entering into a relationship by combining complementary resources such as technology, skills, capital, or distribution channels for the benefit of all parties; the relationship is usually short-term or for a single project/transaction. The situation is not an example of a formal interview. SOURCE: KM:005 SOURCE: Dale, S. (2010, May). Cultivating knowledge through communities of practice.

These aren't technical skills, but they can make the difference between a good manager and a bad one. Marjane's manager wants her to improve her soft skills before he promotes her, so she should focus on learning about things like teamwork and communication. She can do this by taking a course, asking a mentor at work to help her, or taking on a volunteer project where she can work on these skills. Either way, Marjane's boss will probably be pleased to see her take the initiative. Getting an advanced degree and becoming proficient in a new computer program are technical skills.

If businesses take disciplinary action against a whistle-blower, they are being unethical because the employee has the right to report wrongdoing. Unethical discipline might include giving the employee bad performance ratings that are not appropriate or denying promotions that have been earned.

This has a negative effect on the economy because the higher inflation rate means higher prices for goods and services. Although the employees received a raise, the raise was not equal to the rate of inflation, so employees actually lost purchasing power. They have more money to spend, but the goods and services they want cost more than their pay increase.

", "choices": ["A. $315,525 ", "B. $290,882 ", "C. $274,675", "D. $306,377"], "answer": "D", "reasoning": "$306,377. One of the main functions of an operating budget is to plan for income. Businesses want to know that they are generating a sufficient income to make operating worthwhile. Budgeting for anticipated increases in sales and expenses helps a business to budget income for the coming year. In this situation, sales are expected to increase by 7% and expenses are expected to increase by 4%. To calculate the increase in sales, multiply last year's sales by 7% ($690,500 x 7% or .07 = $48,335), and add that figure to the amount of sales ($690,500 + $48,335 = $738,835). To calculate the increase in expenses, multiply last year's expenses by 4% ($415,825 x 4% or .04 = $16,633), and add that figure to the amount of expenses ($415,825 + $16,633 = $432,458).

Certain pricing practices are usually considered unethical if they are basically dishonest or immoral. One pricing practice that is considered unethical is promoting low-priced items that are unavailable for customers to purchase. Businesses that use such pricing tactics do so only to attract customers and then try to sell them more expensive items. When customers visit the business to buy the low-priced items, they are told that those items are sold out. This is unethical because the business never had the low-priced items and advertised them only to attract customers with the intention of selling them higher priced items. It is not unethical to offer customers better quality products as long as the low-priced items are available. Businesses do not promote lowpriced items that are unavailable to match the prices advertised by competitors.

Whistleblower laws are not applicable in this situation unless the disclosure breaks privacy laws and is reported by a healthcare employee. SOURCE: BL:029 SOURCE: Jennings, M.M. (2000).

A patent is legal protection of an invention or a process granted by government to its owners for a certain number of years. A patent gives a business the sole right to make, use, or sell its invention within that period of time. One of the reasons why the federal government awards patents is to encourage businesses to do research and continue to develop new ideas and products. If businesses have the sole right to profit from their inventions, they are more likely to continue investing money in research and development. Patents protect the business that invented the product rather than the consumer. A patent actually gives a business a monopoly on the invention for a number of years.

Arbitrators are appointed by a governing body to make a final decision about a dispute. Binding arbitration decisions are not overturned because both parties agree to adhere to the decision before the process begins. An attorney is usually hired to assess a party's legal options related to a dispute, rather than a mediator. SOURCE: BL:045 SOURCE: Jennings, M.M. (2000).

For example, a business might decide that producing 500 widgets a day will generate the most profit given its current combination of size, equipment, supplies, raw materials, and employees. If it adds another employee, production might increase slightly but profitability would decrease.

Therefore, the fairness of some countries' laws is often subjective in nature. Some laws are general and open for judicial interpretation. Since ethics are the personal principles that govern an individual's own behavior, it provides the individual with order and consistency rather than the entire society.

When there is an abundance of properties for rent or sale, or fewer business owners are looking for facilities to rent, there is more competition among property owners for buyers or leasers.

Therefore, facility owners are often more likely to agree to potential leaser's requests (e.g., lower rent, interior painting) in order to obtain cash inflow from the rentals. Ownership of multiple properties does not necessarily mean that the property owner is willing to provide concessions during lease negotiations. Tax rates are established by governments and are not negotiable. A facility owner would probably have an easier time finding tenants for a property that is located in a popular location.

Many businesses hire employees to create or invent goods and services to sell. A patent legally provides the owner the sole rights of the new product for a certain amount of time. When an employee invents a product as a part of his/her job duties, ownership rights generally belong to the employer. To further protect the business's legal ownership of the invention, it is best for employers to have employees sign an invention assignment agreement at the time of hire. This agreement is a document that transfers invention ownership from the inventor (employee) to the employer. The government issues patents rather than a trade association. Applying for a utility patent does not automatically transfer patent ownership rights. A nondisclosure clause is a statement in a contract in which the employee promises not to tell others (e.g., competitors) about the employer's trade secrets. SOURCE: BL:037 SOURCE: Oswald, L.J.

When businesses negotiate long-term leases, they often negotiate the amount of increase from year to year. In this example, the rent will increase 2% the second year. To calculate the monthly rent for the second year, multiply the first year rate by the rate of increase ($2,250 x 2% or .02 = $45), and add that amount to the first year rate ($2,250 + $45 = $2,295). The third year, monthly rent will increase 3% over the second year's rate of $2,295. To calculate that amount, multiply the second year rate by the rate of increase ($2,295 x 3% or .03 = $68.85) and add that amount to the second year rate ($2,295.00 + $68.85 = $2,363.85).

There are many ways that businesses can control their operating expenses. One of these is to lease equipment rather than buy it. Businesses often are able to lease equipment and pay for it on a monthly basis over a period of time, which saves paying the purchase price in one lump sum. Also, leased equipment can be returned at the end of the lease agreement and replaced with new equipment, which often saves the business repair expense. Sometimes, businesses need specialized equipment for a certain project, and it is more economical to lease it for a short time than to buy equipment that will not be needed again. Buying in small quantities is often more costly than buying in large quantities. Obtaining credit does not control expenses because a business must repay the loan with interest. Organizing inventory space does not necessarily help to control operating expenses. SOURCE: OP:029 SOURCE: Meyer, E.C., & Allen, K.R. (2000).

When a company prices its products below cost, it makes it difficult for other companies to compete with the low prices, which they cannot afford to charge, and might eventually force them out of business. To prevent this situation from happening, many governments have laws that make it illegal for businesses to use below-cost pricing. When a business charges one price for all items it sells, it is using a one-price policy. Price skimming is a pricing strategy that involves setting prices higher than those of the competition.
