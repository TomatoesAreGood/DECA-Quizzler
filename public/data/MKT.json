As a result, the business might avoid losing customers, which is a future risk. Managers often use marketing information to prepare documents and reports, but that is not an advantage of obtaining and using the information. Business managers do not obtain and use marketing information to train and direct employees, or to review and understand regulations. SOURCE: IM:012 SOURCE: Zikmund, W., & d'Amico, M. (2001).

Price fixing is an illegal business agreement in which businesses agree on prices of their goods or services, resulting in little choice for the consumer. Businesses that discuss their costs, markups, and prices with competing businesses may be involved in price fixing. In order to avoid possible price-fixing charges, businesses should not discuss any pricing issues with competitors. Variable pricing involves changing prices according to demand. Price lining is the practice of selling goods/services at a limited number of predetermined price points. Flexible pricing involves charging different customers different prices.

During this phase of the business cycle, business activity slows down. As a result, unemployment occurs and consumers tend to buy less because they have less disposable income, which lowers demand. In response to lower demand, businesses often reduce their prices in order to survive until demand increases. Recovery and prosperity are phases of the business cycle that experience an increase in demand and spending. It is during these phases that demand can exceed supply. As a result, businesses are more likely to increase their prices. Deflation is not a common term used to describe a phase in the business cycle.

Channel members are the businesses or individuals who assist in moving goods and services from the producer to the consumer. When one channel member is planning a sales promotion, it should advise the other channel members so they can make sure products are available when and where they are needed to meet increased demand. If the channel member does not tell the producer about the sales promotion, it may not produce enough products to send to the channel member to sell to the end users. Transporters (e.g., trucking companies) do not usually need to hire order takers for another channel member's sales promotion. Although advising the producer about a sales promotion may reduce inventory stock-outs, the risk cannot be eliminated. Inventory shrinkage is the loss of inventory due to shoplifting, employee theft, breakage, misplaced goods, or poor recordkeeping.

Strong leaders have the authority and power to influence others and direct the actions of others. A channel of distribution that has strong leadership is often able to avoid conflict within the channel because the leader has the authority to set goals for the entire channel and demand cooperation, which reduces the possibility of conflict. The leader's authority makes it possible for the leader to assign specific responsibilities to each channel member and persuade members to accomplish their individual tasks. When each member is cooperating and working for the good of the channel, there is less chance of conflict. It is not necessary for the leader to develop friendships. Channel leaders usually do not provide training. It is not possible to regulate change, although an effective leader will help channel members adjust to change.

Businesses discontinue products for many reasons, such as decreasing sales and profits. In other situations, the reason is because the business has developed an altered version of the product or a new model. After deciding to discontinue the product, the business must decide whether to provide replacement parts. In some situations, many of the discontinued products remain in use in the marketplace. If replacement parts are available for purchase to fix the damaged product, then an owner can still use the product. However, if parts are not available and the product becomes unusable, then the owner may need to purchase another product, either the business's newer model of the product or a similar product that one of the business's competitors offers. This often creates an ethical dilemma because a very expensive, complex product, such as a piece of machinery, can be very costly to owners to replace. Reducing the prices of discontinued products is a common practice and is ethical if the business advises the buyer that the products are being discontinued. If there are a lot of similar products readily available, then advising the public about other similar products on the market is not necessary.

A slotting fee is a cash premium that producers pay to businesses to cover the costs associated with carrying a new product. In many cases, the producer that offers the largest fee is the one that gets shelf space for its new product. This presents an unethical situation because many small producers cannot afford to pay large slotting fees, which limits the introduction of new items in the marketplace. Exclusive dealing is an illegal practice when it restricts competition; however, it may be legal when small businesses are entering the marketplace. Direct distribution is a channel of distribution in which products move directly from the producer to the end user. Slotting fees may hinder a business's ability to distribute its products to the target market, but the slotting fees do not limit the business's ability to identify potential target markets.

Channel members are all of the businesses and individuals that assist in moving goods and services from the producer to the consumer. In many situations, producers will assist other channel members (e.g., dealers, distributors, retailers) in sales promotions. One way to assist channel members planning a sales promotion in a certain area is by providing resources (e.g., money, product samples) to develop an advertising campaign. The goal of the advertising campaign is to communicate information about the sales promotion to consumers in order to stimulate interest and sales. The producer may provide assistance by developing new products and identifying market trends, but these activities do not relate to a specific sales promotion. An accounting system refers to the methods and procedures a business uses in handling its financial information.

A channel of distribution that has strong leadership is often able to manage or avoid conflict because the leadership has the power to assign specific responsibilities to each channel member. Strong leadership has the authority to set goals for the entire channel and demand cooperation, which reduces the possibility of conflict. When a channel has strong leadership, channel members work for the good of the channel rather than for their individual goals. A channel of distribution does not need updated technology or limited competition to manage or avoid conflict within the channel.

A new electronics manufacturer engages in direct distribution strategies.", "B. An automobile manufacturer provides its authorized dealers with rebate programs.", "C. A retail business awards a construction contract to the company with the lowest bid.", "D. A restaurant franchisee uses unauthorized food suppliers that compromise brand integrity."], "answer": "D", "reasoning": "A restaurant franchisee uses unauthorized food suppliers that compromise brand integrity. Horizontal conflict is defined as disagreement among channel members that perform distribution activities at the same level. For example, restaurant franchisees must follow the rules that the parent company (franchisor) establishes in the franchise agreement. Using unauthorized suppliers is not only a breach of contract, but is compromising brand integrity by using products that the franchisor might consider below standard. This can create conflict among other franchisees who are following the rules. Direct distribution is the channel of distribution in which goods and services move directly from the producer to the consumer or industrial user. Since the manufacturer is a new company, it is not creating conflict by engaging in direct distribution since it has not established a dealership arrangement. A manufacturer that provides authorized dealers with rebate programs does not necessarily create conflict among its dealers. Soliciting bids and awarding contracts are common business practices and can create normal economic competition. SOURCE: CM:008 SOURCE: Kurtz, D. (2013).

Photo management, freeform application, and remote access are not types of software programs that businesses use to plan, build, modify, or customize products. SOURCE: PM:039 SOURCE: Hunt, J.

It indicates the audience's respect for the speaker, and its desire to hear what the speaker has to say. Because cheering provides positive feedback, the audience was not mocking or insulting the speaker. Some cultures might view the audience's behavior as unruly or disrespectful; however, this situation involves a school event, rather than a business event, so the audience isn't exhibiting unprofessional behavior.

The cash conversion cycle is the ratio that reflects the number of days between a company paying for raw materials and receiving cash from selling the products made from those raw materials. The longer this period of time, the longer the company's money is tied up and unavailable for other uses. Therefore, a financial manager strives to keep the cash conversion cycle as short as possible, so that the business has more free cash to work with. A dividend is the amount of money that a corporation pays to a stockholder as earnings on an investment. The profit margin is a product pricing consideration. The profit margin is the amount of money that a business earns on sales after expenses and is expressed as a ratio. Liquid assets are things of value that the business owns, which can be quickly converted to cash.

Advances in technology have created software that allows for real-time analysis of marketing information. The benefit of this software to businesses is that it enables them to search many databases and identify obscure relationships. The software allows businesses to analyze the data as it is collected and compare it with information stored in many other databases. For example, real-time analysis might discover that a customer applying for store credit has the same telephone number as another customer who recently declared bankruptcy. This information would be immediately made available to the credit manager. Pricing strategies are plans for setting prices. A hidden objection is a real objection the customer does not want brought out in the open.

Businesses occasionally make honest pricing mistakes. An employee may forget to key in the sale price of an item or key it incorrectly into the computer system. When this happens the customer is charged an incorrect amount for the item when it is scanned at the checkout counter. On the other hand, scanner fraud is a deliberate action that involves overcharging customers, usually for smaller goods, with the expectation the customer will not notice or fuss about it. This is unethical behavior because the business is acting in a deceptive, intentional way to pad the business's bottom line. Predatory pricing is the practice of pricing goods extremely low with the goal of driving the competition out of business. Retail price maintenance involves producers pressuring retailers to sell goods at the suggested retail price, which is unethical and, in some jurisdictions, an illegal practice. Price fixing is an illegal agreement in which businesses agree on prices of their goods or services, resulting in little choice for customers. SOURCE: PI:015 SOURCE: Kotler, P., & Armstrong G.

Channel members are all of the businesses or individuals that move goods and services from the producer to the end user. The channel members depend on each other to make sure the end users receive the products when they need them and where they need them. Therefore, it is important for all channel members to remember that their common goal is customer satisfaction, especially when one or more of them disagree about a course of action that another channel member wants to take. Producers are not always channel leaders, nor do they necessarily have more negotiating power. Because the channel members are interdependent, interaction among the members is necessary.

Phishing occurs when a scammer sends out an email pretending to be a legitimate company, such as a credit card company, in order to gain personal information.

The legislative branch of the government (i.e., U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament) establishes governmental agencies and gives them authority to enact and enforce regulations for three specific administrative functions. One administrative function is the control of supply for specific activities.

An automatic identification system uses electronic bar coding symbols to transmit information. Businesses often use bar coding as a way to keep track of their inventory and reorder stock.

Channel management is the process by which marketers ensure that products are distributed to customers efficiently and effectively. Coordinating channel management with other marketing activities is important because the store must have items available to sell to the customers. This involves ordering the appropriate amount of items and ensuring that the items are delivered to the store before the promotional event or sale. Stores that promote goods they do not have in stock often annoy the customers who want to buy the items. A selective distribution strategy is a distribution pattern in which a producer sells a product through a limited number of intermediaries in a geographic location. An intensive distribution strategy involves a producer selling a product through every available intermediary. A business would not change its overall distribution strategy for a single promotional event. Hiring additional warehouse staff and sending copies of promotional literature to vendors will not ensure that the store has enough products available to meet the demand for the items during the sale.

Appropriation, which Brix Beauty Salon committed, involves a business or person who uses\u2014without permission\u2014another person's name, likeness, and other unique characteristics for the benefit or gain of the user. Brix Beauty Salon used the celebrity's name and picture to attract customers to the salon. Unfortunately, Brix had not obtained permission to use the celebrity's name or likeness. As a result, the celebrity could sue Brix for appropriation. Wrongful interference consists of predatory behavior undertaken by a business to draw either customers or employees away from a competitor.

Businesses establish different types of security procedures to protect their assets\u2014equipment, inventory, facilities, money, information, and employees. Businesses need to communicate these security procedures to employees so the employees know what they need to do to maintain a secure work environment. If employees do not follow security procedures, the risk of security breaches occurring increases. For example, an employee who does not properly lock the cash drawer increases the risk of robbery. If employees fail to lock the warehouse doors at the end of business hours, the risk of theft increases. If a security breach occurs, the business may experience financial losses (e.g., stolen money, goods, and equipment). Employees follow safety procedures to reduce the risk of accidents in the workplace. Financial losses may decrease if businesses train their employees to identify counterfeit paper money at the point of sale. SOURCE: OP:152 SOURCE: Daciuk, E.

However, there is no guarantee that the media will publish or broadcast the information. As a result, businesses use other techniques to market products, advertise an image, and target customers.

Some items, such as carpeting for your home or office, are expensive items that are not purchased frequently. These types of goods involve a lot of thought and consideration, but many buyers do not perceive great differences among brands. Buyers may be more concerned with appearance, feel, and durability rather than brand. This type of buying behavior is called dissonance-reducing buying behavior. Routine (habitual) buying behavior involves buying inexpensive goods on a frequent basis (e.g., sugar, orange juice). These types of purchases require little involvement or thought, and in most situations, there are few differences among brands. Complex buying behavior involves high customer involvement because the items are expensive and purchased infrequently. Because strong brand recognition or product characteristics are extremely important, complex buying behavior is most often exhibited when an individual is purchasing a car or a home.

Body language is gestures, facial expression, tone of voice, or any other form of communicating without words. An employee's body language conveys a message to customers. For example, if an employee is talking to one customer and ignores a new customer, the employee's body language is telling the new customer that s/he is not important.

Items that are sold on the gray market cannot be tracked by manufacturers or producers, making it difficult for the makers of a product to understand how their product is being used (or abused).

A warranty is a promise made by the seller to the customer that the seller will repair or replace a product that does not perform as expected. There are several types of warranties, including limited, full, implied, and express. Full and limited warranties are two classifications of warranties based on the extent of the promises they make. Some products carry a full warranty. A full warranty states that if the product does not work properly, is defective, or does not live up to the warranty, it must be made good within a reasonable time. The company providing the warranty may not put time limits on any implied warranties the product may have. If the problem cannot be corrected in a reasonable time, the customer does not have to wait longer but may choose a refund or a replacement. The customer need only notify the warrantor to obtain repairs. A limited warranty is one that does not have all of the provisions of a full warranty. Instead of covering the entire product, it may cover specific parts, certain repairs, or a particular time period. An implied warranty is not written or stated orally.
