Most financial-analysis software calculates the different financial ratios automatically and then evaluates those ratios to determine company strengths and weaknesses for the user. DuPont modeling helps the user examine the impact of each financial ratio on return on equity. Forecasting features are often used to make predictions, develop budgets, and experiment with \"what-if\" scenarios. SOURCE: FM:014 SOURCE: Jackson, A. (2014, June 13).

Businesses are constantly looking for ways to use their resources more efficiently. Two popular methods of achieving this goal are lean operations (manufacturing) and Six Sigma. The leanoperations method involves eliminating waste (the ineffective use of resources) to improve efficiency. According to the lean-operations philosophy, when efficiency increases, the business will have fewer errors, which leads to higher profits. Six Sigma is a quality-management framework that involves continuously setting higher goals of perfection. The Six Sigma framework builds upon previous goals to set higher goals, which continuously improves the quality of the business's goods, services, or processes. The ultimate goal is to maximize outputs, have no process or product defects, and minimize production costs. Therefore, an important aspect of the Six Sigma philosophy is to continuously lower costs while improving quality. Lean operations do not focus on reducing wages, automation, or standards.

Staying focused on the message and filtering out noise as much as possible improves the chances of remembering and accurately understanding the message. Listeners may want to be aware of their own body language (e.g., facial expressions, crossed arms) because their nonverbal cues are also being interpreted by the speaker and can affect communication. However, monitoring one's own nonverbal cues does not necessarily mean that the listener takes control of the conversation. Asking questions during the speaker's message does not necessarily reduce listening blocks or barriers.

There is no indication that Jonathan provides his customers with too much information. Hank is not likely to retain and grow his client base simply because he is optimistic. And, while customers appreciate an upbeat salesperson, they are likely to get angry with Hank if something goes wrong that Hank could have warned them about.

Risk management is a business activity that involves the planning, controlling, preventing, and procedures to limit business losses. An important aspect of risk management involves complying with laws. If a business does not comply with laws, then it may face a lawsuit. If the business loses the lawsuit, it may be required to pay money to the plaintiff. For example, if an employee is severely injured on the job, s/he might decide to file a lawsuit against the business for negligent behavior. If the court finds that the business acted negligently because it didn't follow safety regulations, then the business may be required to pay the employee, which is costly to the business.

Interest is the amount of money the investment issuer pays an investor for using the investor's money. Depending on the type of investment (e.g., savings account), interest is compounded at certain intervals (e.g., daily, quarterly, annually), which means that interest is earned upon the previous interest amount earned. In the example, the interest is compounded annually. To determine the value of Amelia's savings account after two years, first calculate the interest earned after the first year. Do this by multiplying the savings account deposit amount by the interest percentage rate, then add the interest amount earned to the savings account deposit amount ($250 x .0625 or 6.25% = $15.63; $250 + 15.63 = $265.63). After one year, the money is worth $265.63. Now, the interest begins to compound, and you must determine the value of the money in the savings account at the end of the second year. Do this by multiplying the savings account balance (amount) at the end of the first year by the interest percentage rate ($265.63 x .0625 or 6.25% = $16.60).

An employee should report the noncompliance so the government can step in and ensure that the business takes corrective action before an accident occurs and someone is injured. By reporting noncompliance of safety regulations, the employee may prevent a tragedy from occurring and prevent the business from receiving poor publicity and a bad reputation that would likely result from an accident or injury.

For example, several employees may have a common goal to improve a production process so they can perform their jobs more efficiently. Once the improvements have been made, the group would likely dissolve. Employees may engage in backstabbing practices to advance their careers, but this is not normal behavior for most workers. Exclusive groups can form in any type of group or organization, but do not always result in inefficiencies or conflict. Conflict or disagreement is unavoidable in business\u2014the way the conflict is handled influences the outcome. SOURCE: EI:034 SOURCE: Rawes, E.M. (2016).

Budgeting software, which is generally much more sophisticated than standard spreadsheet software, allows business owners and managers to study each item in a budget individually as well as together as a whole. Owners and managers can see the impact that different actions have on a business's budget, both before and after these actions take place. The software also allows them to pinpoint business units/products that are underperforming and helps them to determine suitable corrective action. Creating line-item projections using standard spreadsheet software can be extremely time-consuming, but budgeting applications shorten the process considerably. Spreadsheet software also makes it difficult to adapt to unexpected events and changing economic conditions, while budgeting software is much more nimble. Therefore, budgets prepared with budgeting-specific software are much easier and simpler to modify.

However, securing fair, favorable premium rates from insurers through ethical, honest actions is acceptable.

To determine how much your investments will be worth in five years, calculate the future values of the investments.

So, the future value of your first investment is equal to $5,000 X (1 + 0.06)5 . To solve this equation, first add one to the interest rate (1+ 0.06 = 1.06). Next, raise this sum to the fifth power, which is the same as multiplying the sum by itself five times (1.065 = 1.06 X 1.06 X 1.06 X 1.06 X 1.06 = 1.3382). Finally, multiply this product by the original amount of the first investment to find its future value ($5,000 X 1.3382 = $6,691). Next, repeat the process for the second investment. Its future value is equal to $15,000 X (1 + 0.09)5 . First, add one to the interest rate (1+ 0.09 = 1.09). Then, raise this sum to the fifth power, which is the same as multiplying the sum by itself five times (1.095 = 1.09 X 1.09 X 1.09 X 1.09 X 1.09 = 1.5386). Next, multiply this product by the original amount of the second investment to find its future value ($15,000 X 1.5386 = $23,079).

Net income, dividends declared, and total stockholders' equity appear within the statement of changes in stockholders' equity, but they are not the most significant or major sections in that financial statement.

If the data contained in a business's customer-relationship-management (CRM) system is incorrect, out-of-date, duplicated, or unformatted, the value and effectiveness of the CRM system is potentially compromised.

Most businesses use a combination of security measures to secure their facilities, including door and window locks and different types of alarm systems. Businesses need and use different types of alarm systems, such as fire alarms or smoke detectors, which are often required by law. Therefore, the use of surveillance cameras does not eliminate the need for alarm systems. Extortion is blackmail and would not necessarily be impacted by surveillance cameras.

When businesses evaluate the cost of purchasing certain assets in the hope that these assets will have significantly more value in the future, they are assessing whether the risk of investing is worth the expected return. Businesses often take the risk of investing in certain assets because they believe the assets will increase in value. The tradeoff is spending money now in order to have more valuable assets in the future. However, the risk is that the assets will decrease in value and the business will lose money. Cash-flow projections are predictions of whether the cash generated by a business can cover the operating expenses and loan repayments.

Many businesses control expenses by hiring part-time employees at an hourly rate instead of salaried, full-time employees. The advantage to the business is the same number of employees working during a given time period but for less wages. To calculate the savings, first determine the weekly payroll expense for one part-time employee by multiplying the number of hours worked each week by the hourly rate ($11.50 x 20 =$230). Then, multiply that amount by the four part-time employees ($230 x 4 = $920); and the total weekly amount by the two-week pay period ($920 x 2 = $1,840). Next, determine what the payroll would be for two full-time employees by multiplying the weekly salary by the number of employees and that amount by the two-week pay period ($575 x 2 = $1,150; $1,150 x 2 = $2,300). Then, subtract the two-week, part-time payroll from the two-week, full-time payroll to determine the amount the business will save ($2,300 - $1,840 = $460). SOURCE:\tOP:029 SOURCE:\tBizMove.com.
