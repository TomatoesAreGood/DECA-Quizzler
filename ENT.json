Due to his efforts, peoples' attitudes changed and laws were established to protect and ensure all peoples' rights, which created permanent results from his vision. When working toward a personal vision, a person may experience setbacks and challenges, such as limited resources.

Risk management is a business activity that involves the planning, controlling, preventing, and procedures to limit business losses. An important aspect of risk management involves complying with laws. If a business does not comply with laws, then it may face a lawsuit. If the business loses the lawsuit, it may be required to pay money to the plaintiff. For example, if an employee is severely injured on the job, s/he might decide to file a lawsuit against the business for negligent behavior. If the court finds that the business acted negligently because it didn't follow safety regulations, then the business may be required to pay the employee, which is costly to the business. Acquiring insurance that offers lower premiums saves the business money and is not always related to business regulations. Customer-satisfaction levels are not always related to the business's compliance issues.

Most businesses have specific policies that provide guidelines for the ways in which employees are expected to carry out their tasks. Following these guidelines can save the business money.

Organizations (i.e., corporations, industry/professional/trade associations) often form their own insurance companies, which are known as captive insurance companies. The founding organizations control their captive insurance companies' underwriting processes, premium rates, and claims-processing policies. This is an advantage to the founding companies because a primary reason they form their own insurance companies is they often carry risks that commercial insurance companies do not cover. For example, mining companies tend to carry more risk due to the dangerous nature of the mining process.

Risk management is a business activity that involves the planning, controlling, preventing, and procedures to limit business losses. An important aspect of risk management involves complying with laws. If a business does not comply with laws, then it may face a lawsuit. If the business loses the lawsuit, it may be required to pay money to the plaintiff. For example, if an employee is severely injured on the job, s/he might decide to file a lawsuit against the business for negligent behavior. If the court finds that the business acted negligently because it didn't follow safety regulations, then the business may be required to pay the employee, which is costly to the business.

When would-be burglars see surveillance cameras in several locations around a business, they are less likely to attempt to break in because they will be videotaped or photographed by the cameras. When the burglars' actions are taped, law enforcement agencies are more likely to identify and arrest them. Although surveillance cameras don't prevent all burglaries or robberies, they can often deter these activities. Most businesses use a combination of security measures to secure their facilities, including door and window locks and different types of alarm systems. Businesses need and use different types of alarm systems, such as fire alarms or smoke detectors, which are often required by law. Therefore, the use of surveillance cameras does not eliminate the need for alarm systems. Extortion is blackmail and would not necessarily be impacted by surveillance cameras.

When the money supply is loose, there is more money in circulation, which means there is more money available to loan.

Many businesses control expenses by hiring part-time employees at an hourly rate instead of salaried, full-time employees. The advantage to the business is the same number of employees working during a given time period but for less wages.

Then, multiply that amount by the four part-time employees ($230 x 4 = $920); and the total weekly amount by the two-week pay period ($920 x 2 = $1,840). Next, determine what the payroll would be for two full-time employees by multiplying the weekly salary by the number of employees and that amount by the two-week pay period ($575 x 2 = $1,150; $1,150 x 2 = $2,300).

There are several advantages to the sales force composite. More accurate forecasts for individual products can usually be obtained because sales personnel have first-hand knowledge about demand for certain products as a result of their constant contact with customers.

It also provides as much detail as the business might need because the business can forecast sales for individual products and for an overall company sales forecast. The Delphi sales-forecasting method can take a lot of time; therefore, it is expensive. The survey of buyer intentions sales forecasting method is not always accurate since customers sometimes can't make accurate predictions of their buying intentions.

Intentional torts are voluntary acts of harm against a protected interest. In order for a tort to be intentional, the intent to harm must be proven. In this case, the restaurant intended to harm its competitor by making false claims about its hygiene standards. Negligent torts occur when harm is caused accidentally due to carelessness. Strict liability torts occur when someone is responsible for harm without proof of carelessness. Criminal acts are public wrongs that harm society as a whole, rather than causing harm to particular people or businesses, as is the case with torts. SOURCE: BL:069 SOURCE: Laws.com (2017).

Businesses often obtain financing to purchase buildings or additional facilities such as warehouses. In most cases, banks will loan a percentage of the purchase price, such as 80% or 85%, and expect the business to pay the difference. Sometimes a business will not have sufficient cash to pay the difference and may need to obtain secondary financing. In this example, a business has $20,000 to pay towards the purchase price for a balance of $155,000 ($175,000 - $20,000 = $155,000). A bank has agreed to finance 80% of the purchase price ($175,00 x 80% or .80 = $140,000).

Many maintenance contracts are available with a variety of optional features that usually add to the overall cost of the contract.

Businesses consider historical data and estimated sales to determine how much to spend on promotion. A sales report provides information about a firm's sales volume. A competitive analysis is an evaluation of a competitor's activities. Publicity is any nonpersonal presentation of ideas, goods, or services that is not paid for by the company or individual that benefits or is harmed by it. SOURCE: EN:008 SOURCE: Mintz, L.

If a business increases sales by 15%, it will probably increase revenue, also. To determine the amount of increase in this example, first determine the current level of sales by multiplying the amount each customer spends by the number of customers ($10,000 X 250 = $2,500,000). Then, multiply current sales by the projected increase ($2,500,000 X 15% or .15 = $375,000).

In this example, a financial institution will loan the business 85% of the $146,500 worth of equipment. To calculate the additional amount that the business needs to obtain, first determine the amount the financial institution will loan by multiplying the percentage by the value of the equipment ($146,500 X 85% [or .85] = $124,525).

It determines the amount of cash the business has to work with at any given time. Cash flow is an important part of a business's capacity to repay a loan, which is one of the criteria that banks use when evaluating loan applications. Therefore, a business's cash flow is usually the primary source for repaying the loan. If a business has sufficient cash flow, banks usually are more willing to loan money because there are funds available to repay the debt. Fixed assets are items of value a business owns that are not expected to change, such as a building. Fixed assets might be a secondary source because they can be sold to repay a loan.

Risk management involves identifying, analyzing, and evaluating potential risks so they can be effectively managed. When a company's business objectives are clearly stated, it is easier to identify how important a specific risk is. Achieving a desired amount of profit is dependent on many factors and is not achieved solely by identifying risk or developing clearly stated business objectives. Developing clearly stated business objectives is just one activity involved in designing an overall risk management strategy. An overall risk management strategy is a complex and strategic business management tool that has many important components (e.g., risk assessment matrix analysis and formal contingency plans) to reduce actual risks. Since business risks are an inherent part of conducting business, it is impossible to eliminate them\u2014no matter how clearly stated the company's business objectives are.

To build and maintain customer relationships, a company's brand promise should strive to create positive experiences for customers\u2014experiences that will encourage them to return to the business again and again. Companies use various touchpoints to create these experiences for their customers. Touchpoints are all of the opportunities that a company has to connect with its customers and reinforce its brand value. Touchpoints may include the company's employees, product attributes and packaging, and technological systems (e.g., phone, website). A slogan (tag line) is a phrase that is easy to remember, such as \"Nationwide is on your side.\" A trade character is a symbol that is personified (e.g., Tony the Tiger). Businesses often use slogans and trade characters as elements of their brands. Changing slogans frequently or developing different trade characters may confuse customers, which may reduce brand recognition. One reason that businesses establish certain types of policies (e.g., sales, service) is to ensure that customers are treated fairly. Establishing different policies for different customers is not treating customers fairly, and in some circumstances, such actions are illegal.

Next, multiply the total monthly rental expense by 12, the number of months in a year: $1,650 X 12 = $19,800. Now, determine how much the small-business owner would pay if they bought the furniture. Multiply the furniture cost per person by the number of people needing furniture: $6,500 X 6 = $39,000.

Businesses analyze financial data to evaluate the financial well-being of their operations at any given time. By comparing the same type of financial information from different consecutive time periods, a business can detect trends. By detecting trends, the business can determine if it needs to make changes. For example, if the business notices a substantial increase in sales-dollar volume over a three-month period, trends indicate an increase in spending. The business may decide to conduct further analysis to determine what customers are purchasing, and decide if it needs to increase the production or inventory levels of certain products.

The only source for any money that is generated through participation in a supply chain must come from the ultimate sale of the end product. Without this sale, no supply chain member will be able to receive revenues. Raw materials used in manufacturing play into the expenses side of the supply chain, but there are more expenses than just the raw materials.

Conducting a SWOT analysis helps a business determine what it is doing well and where it needs to improve. When examining the business's weaknesses, it should ask itself what resources it lacks. When a business lacks certain resources, it cannot operate efficiently, which reduces its ability to effectively compete in the marketplace. Therefore, it is important for the business to objectively look at its resource shortages and take steps to improve the situation. When the business asks a question about its competitors' activities, it is seeking information about a threat. When a business asks a question about particular markets the competitors have missed, it is examining opportunities. The assets, or things of value that a business has, are its strengths.

An important part of monitoring quality is soliciting input from the workers who are actually performing the tasks, because they often have ideas that will help them do their jobs with more efficiency.

Regulatory and environmental factors that affect process design include government regulations and the political or social environment surrounding a company.

To calculate the percentage of gross profit, first subtract the cost of goods sold from annual sales to determine gross profit ($500,000 - $400,000 = $100,000).

Instead, focus on behaviors and results, both of which can be directly observed and can be applied to each employee. Employee evaluations can be conducted for either development or compensation. However, discussions about employee development and compensation should be held separately. The evaluator should be a supervisor or manager who the employee interacts with regularly or on a daily basis. This person is in the best position to accurately assess the employee's performance. Evaluation meetings or performance discussions should be conducted on a regular basis and on a schedule that is well-known to both parties. SOURCE: HR:368 SOURCE: Gallagher, B.J. (2020, January 7).

Customer profiling is the process of identifying a business's most likely or ideal customer through the use of demographic, psychographic, attitudinal, and behavioral information. If a business implements an effective customer profiling system, it leads to better customer service. By documenting customers' characteristics, a company will be able to predict issues before they come up, offer useful self-help resources, and better align with customer needs if they reach out to the business's service team. Instead of increasing the price of a campaign, it will lower it. The more specific the customer, the less money a business will spend. Rather than making the customer base broader, customer profiling focuses on identifying the specific buyers that'll actually buy a product, which is more valuable than targeting everyone.

Businesspeople prepare cash flow statements to estimate when, where, and how much money will flow into and out of a business during a certain period of time. The information in the cash flow statement can help the business plan and make decisions about its finances.

If the business temporarily closes, it does not have cash coming in. Hiring additional salespeople might help increase cash flow in the long-term, but will not help the business cover expenses in the short-term. The business could sell assets, but a loan would be a better option because the business might be able to deduct the loan interest in terms of its tax obligation.

Dashboards are technology applications that allow management to view and evaluate a process or activity as it occurs. In the example, managers can view the number of callers waiting in queue for service at a given time.

By monitoring and analyzing dashboards, businesses can detect changes or patterns in activity, and use the information to make appropriate adjustments. If dashboards indicate a higher volume of calls between 7 p.m. - 9 p.m. on Tuesdays, the business can take steps to add staff, so customers' wait time is decreased.
